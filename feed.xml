      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than 23 million children in Pakistan do not attend school. More than half of children who start at government schools drop out before completing primary school. These stark facts are harming a rising generation of Pakistanis already vulnerable to unemployment, instability, and extremism. And while upper-class Pakistanis enjoy excellent private schools and universities, much of the rest of the country has become resigned to derelict classrooms and substandard government-provided education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2013 and funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the Alif Ailaan campaign is moving education to the front and center of the 2018 general election, in which 342 seats in parliament are at stake. In vying to make 2018 the “education election,” Alif Ailaan has inspired groups throughout Pakistani society—rural and urban, rich and poor, traditional and progressive—to mobilise in demand of improved public education. The campaign’s “ask” is succinct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better budgets&lt;/strong&gt;—more government funds on education, better spent;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better data&lt;/strong&gt;—led by Alif Ailaan’s annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://rankings.alifailaan.pk/&quot;&gt;Pakistan District Education Rankings&lt;/a&gt; that call out where government education is failing and why;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better teaching&lt;/strong&gt;—with a focus on mathematics and science; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better government schools&lt;/strong&gt;—with an emphasis on the poorest and most vulnerable 40 percent of the population who use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----TEP-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----TEP-2&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1.5 million supporters have signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alifailaan.pk/&quot;&gt;Alif Ailaan&lt;/a&gt; campaign, including politicians from all major parties, educators, parents, and civil society organisations. The campaign’s Facebook account has amassed more than 2 million followers. The question now is whether this groundswell will translate into more and smarter funding for public education, more prestige for teachers, and higher-quality schools for millions of marginalized kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/pakistan-transforming-education-pakistan-tep&quot;&gt;Transforming Education in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; (TEP) project, Alif Ailaan is implemented by DAI and London-based subcontractor Accadian Ltd. TEP’s assistance is not designed to pay for books or desks or rehabilitated schools. Instead, given that the Constitution of Pakistan guarantees government-funded education to every Pakistani child between the ages of 5 and 16, TEP’s job is to make parents aware of this right and help them demand high-quality schooling for their children. At the same time, TEP encourages politicians to deliver on the right to education and work with education providers to improve the quality of that education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is a high-priority country for U.K. assistance. In designing the TEP programme, DFID concluded that a crucial long-term intervention—in terms of stabilisation, economic development, countering violent extremism, and meeting the needs of a fast-growing, younger population—would be to help tackle Pakistan’s education emergency. Alif Ailaan is on track to get more Pakistani children into school, stay there, and achieve literacy, numeracy, and other skills so they can contribute to a more stable and prosperous Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----TEP-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----TEP-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----TEP-graphic-1-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----TEP-graphic-1-new&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Galvanising Political Will, Mobilising Demand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making education politically relevant, DAI and Accadian have drawn on political campaigning techniques to influence political will and mobilise demand. TEP identified and analysed every interest group involved in providing education and constructively engaged those group members willing to be part of positive change while marginalising any blockers. This outreach required creating a strong, independent, authoritative campaign that would become the leading voice for education reform in Pakistan, which is what we have built with Alif Ailaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TEP team, led by DAI&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/mosharraf-zaidi&quot;&gt;Mosharraf Zaidi&lt;/a&gt;,  emphasizes smart political engagement to support reformers across all the main political parties and groupings, and to empower other stakeholders in the education system to understand what needs to be done and start doing it. As we come to the second set of elections to have taken place during the campaign (the first was in 2013), we will be refocusing attention explicitly on voters—especially parents—and helping them to make education a salient issue for politicians seeking their votes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DEVS----TEP-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DEVS----TEP-3&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of Smart Startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In setting up Alif Ailaan, the most important first steps we made were recruiting the best Pakistani campaign team we could find. Our Islamabad-based team of more than 25 people were personally selected and have spent a good deal of time developing their skills as campaigners, first and foremost, and as professionals working to DAI’s high standards. We invested the rest of our inception period in testing our strategies and systems. TEP is not a typical development project—it involves generating political will and pushing for change—so we have been fortunate to have the active support of our colleagues at DFID Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset, TEP had to establish Alif Ailaan as a voice in the public political discourse but first and foremost to make people acknowledge the “education emergency” they face. Key to this was our lobbying the government to research, calculate, and publish a nationally accepted number for out-of-school children. Achieving consensus in 2013 that there were 25 million Pakistani children out of school was a critical initial achievement. Through sustained advocacy and communications efforts, TEP has since developed a layered understanding and buy-in around the four themes central to fixing Pakistan’s education system: budgets, data, quality of teaching, and the focus on government schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DEVS----4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DEVS----4&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----TEP-graphic-2-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----TEP-graphic-2-new&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is Your School Passing or Failing? Click Here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEP made education more pressing and locally relevant to politicians by building and launching a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alifailaan.pk/district_rankings&quot;&gt;nationwide data platform&lt;/a&gt; that uses the government’s own statistics to rate school districts in areas such as grades, security, water and toilets, enrollment, and gender equity. This data is open to parents and politicians alike and has spurred social and political discourse and competition between districts to move up in education rankings. We have also partnered with MIT media labs to track the frequency of media coverage on education stories, which is important to measure the impact of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----TEP-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----TEP-5&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2018 election will mark the end of the current Alif Ailaan campaign and present TEP with two challenges: first, achieving the “education election,” where education gets due prominence and the parties compete in their commitments to improve it; and second, achieving sustainability—embedding practices and ownership so the urgent work of transforming Pakistan’s education system can continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEP has already embedded education issues into the political and social discourse, set a precedent of data-informed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alifailaan.pk/bulletin&quot;&gt;journalism and reporting&lt;/a&gt; on education, pioneered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alifailaan.pk/publications&quot;&gt;ground-breaking publications&lt;/a&gt;, and lobbied for the government to research, calculate, and publish a nationally accepted number for out-of-school children. During and following the 2018 election, we believe the government provision of high-quality education for all Pakistani children will remain a top agenda item in manifestos and political party campaigns. Whoever wins the election will have much work to do. We and our partners will play our part in holding them to their commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Liberia Moves to Reduce Donor Dependence by Improving its Ability to Invest in Itself</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/liberia-moves-to-reduce-donor-dependence-by-improving-its-ability-to-invest-in-itself</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2018 19:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/liberia-moves-to-reduce-donor-dependence-by-improving-its-ability-to-invest-in-itself</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liberia has endured much turmoil in recent decades. Civil wars in the 1990s and 2000s saw the mass destruction of dams, bridges, power lines, and other infrastructure. Many of Liberia&amp;rsquo;s best and brightest citizens emigrated. Suffering from a large budget deficit, its government developed a deeper dependence on foreign aid. Furthermore, the Ebola virus epidemic of 2014–2015 killed more than 4,800 Liberians and terrified the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, after all this, people today in Liberia generally look forward with hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they have reason to do so. Liberia’s donor dependence could increasingly turn to self-reliance—if a second-year program by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) continues its recent success. The program’s goal—improve Liberia&amp;rsquo;s ability to pay for its own development—coincides with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/long-term-fiscal-reform-takes-root-in-el-salvador-and-elsewhere/&quot;&gt;broader movement&lt;/a&gt; by developing countries to mobilize domestic resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its outset in May 2016, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/liberia-revenue-generation-governance-and-growth-rg3&quot;&gt;Revenue Generation for Governance and Growth (RG3)&lt;/a&gt; project engaged the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) to jointly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/uploads/BENCHMARKING%20THE%20TAX%20SYSTEM%20IN%20LIBERIA.pdf&quot;&gt;benchmark Liberia tax policy and administration&lt;/a&gt; against international good practices. As a result, RG3 identified critical gaps and set the stage for tax reform in Liberia. Just one year in, the LRA has already achieved some impressive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaps in Liberia&amp;rsquo;s tax practices identified by RG3’s benchmarking activity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low goods and services, excise, corporate income, and property taxes compared with those of peers (see table below);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No electronic filing or payment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No mobile payments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No tax payments through commercial banks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No excise stamps for enforcement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No tax-return processing center and low data availability as a result;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inability to introduce risk-based audit selection due to the limited data availability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No automated compliance monitoring;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No risk-based arrears management;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No taxpayer advocate office at LRA;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited role of the LRA call center in promoting taxpayer education; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No regular taxpayer surveys.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Great Progress So Far&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for improved domestic resource mobilization and accountability is arising from both the government and taxpayers. Early on, the LRA and RG3 team ramped up taxpayer engagement by increasing the number of taxpayer inquiries to the LRA call center &lt;em&gt;tenfold&lt;/em&gt; through aggressive mobile text-messaging outreach. LRA and RG3 conducted an innovative text-based taxpayer perception survey as well as a cost-of-compliance survey using computer-assisted telephone interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LRA established a centralized data processing center that has already processed information from thousands of tax returns into LRA databases, improving transparency for taxpayers encompassing some 70 percent of revenues and generating crucial information—on topics such as wages, employment, and property ownership—to inform audit selection and improve revenue forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers gained a strong ally in the form of a newly established Taxpayer Advocate’s Office. Already, the office has repeatedly stood up for taxpayer’s rights—in areas such as customs clearance and verification of tax compliance—thereby reducing opportunities for corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAI&amp;rsquo;s Tax Benchmarking Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two decades, DAI has produced tax-benchmarking training and studies for partner governments to assist them in benchmarking tax policy, customs, and tax administration against international good practices. Tax benchmarking helps identify the biggest gaps in tax policy and tax administration, inform tax reform strategy, and prioritize tax reform interventions. DAI is currently implementing fiscal reform and domestic revenue mobilization projects in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/when-tax-reform-leads-to-increased-funding-for-health-services/&quot;&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-state-partnership-accountability-responsiveness-and-capability-sparc&quot;&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/philippines-increases-tax-collections-by-11-billion-year-over-yearwithout-raising-rates/&quot;&gt;the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the LRA allowed taxes to be paid for the first time through commercial banks and their branches, as much as $7.3 million in taxes was paid using this method though August 2017—leading to the first electronic tax payments wired to government coffers and the first, albeit rudimentary, email-based electronic filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LRA and RG3 interventions have also increased compliance. The number of tax payment transactions increased by some 48 percent in March–August 2017 compared with the same period in 2016, which is expected to lead to increased revenues for the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LRA and RG3 are close to launching the first mobile tax payments. And finally, in close cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), RG3 has developed a revised draft excise tax legislation that should help pave the way for a significant revenue increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0__/QBehpEVGpci6ueSMpwHz&quot; title=&quot;Liberia&amp;amp;amp;#39;s Deficit/Revenues vs. GDP&quot; src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?ur0&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a productive first year and the benchmarking exercise, RG3 has established the following objectives for the next phase of the program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve risk-based audit selection so that LRA auditors focus on taxpayer cases that are most likely to yield revenues;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop microsimulation models to forecast revenues and analyze potential policy outcomes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce e-filing to further reduce cash transactions between tax officers and taxpayers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch mobile payments;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze pros and cons of decentralizing real estate tax revenues, so local property taxes pay for local services;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate payment reconciliation so compliant taxpayers are certified as such;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate LRA management reports to improve decision making; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce excise stamps to generate revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Liberian government has been a positive partner in tax reform, and we are hopeful that will continue for two more years under RG3—and beyond—under the newly elected president, former international soccer star George Weah. The government has great upside in terms of revenue generation and, in turn, expenditure management. While Liberia has suffered a great deal over the past two decades, we believe 4.5 million Liberians are eager to see through the tax reforms that will make government more accountable and productive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Women’s Land Rights and the Problem of Polygamy: A Proposal in Ethiopia</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/womens-land-rights-and-the-problem-of-polygamy-a-proposal-in-ethiopia</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 14:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Elizabeth Drachman</author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/womens-land-rights-and-the-problem-of-polygamy-a-proposal-in-ethiopia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being illegal, polygamous marriage remains alive and well in Ethiopia, and that poses some obvious challenges when it comes to land rights. Statistics from 2011 reveal that 11 percent of married women in Ethiopia share a husband with one or two other wives. Polygamy affects women’s rights to property and income because it is unclear whose rights take precedence under the law when the husband becomes ill or passes away. Unfortunately, federal and regional land proclamations in Ethiopia don’t address the registration of polygamous families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Department for International Development’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-land-investment-transformation-lift&quot;&gt;Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT)&lt;/a&gt; programme consistently runs up against this legal grey area in its work to enhance land rights in rural Ethiopia. But based on our research into the topic, we have come up with a couple of suggestions to clarify and advance women’s rights in cases of plural marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/LIFT%20pic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LIFT pic&quot; title=&quot;The LIFT team performing research.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different regions of the country handle the registration of polygamous families in different ways: some include all the wives in one certificate; others register wives separately. Also, registration of land holdings is typically led by the husband, who may treat one wife better than others, leaving co-wives at a legal disadvantage. A husband who favors one wife over another can encourage non-eligible wives to register, denying those who are eligible. Many co-wives may not even know whether they are listed as a joint land owner or the extent of their entitlement to land. In regions where photos of co-wives are required for land registration, co-wives often think that this photo ensures joint ownership of land and hence that they do not need to be involved in subsequent stages of land certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other complicated situations include instances where a parcel of land is registered in the name of the first wife, but in practice a co-wife actually cultivates and benefits from the produce. This state of affairs poses a problem upon division of the property, as the land certificate does not reflect the user, and of course a divorce or death of one of the wives or the husband naturally triggers disputes around the division of property and inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land differs by nature from other kinds of property—perhaps especially in Ethiopia. The country’s land policy posits that land is not owned by individuals but by the State and the people of Ethiopia. When wives in polygamous marriages request land, therefore, it is a demand they are making as a citizen, not merely as a spouse. It is well documented that recognizing and formalising women’s land rights is a key step toward women’s economic and social advancement, as land is the most important social and economic asset in rural Ethiopia. These rights increase women’s economic empowerment and status in the household and community, and help to ensure the health and wellbeing of children. This right should therefore be granted equally, to include women in polygamous households.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_6fdec906-bda6-4fb0-9ab8-eda4cb2aab34&quot; title=&quot;LIFT Pie&quot; src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?Fe6&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What to Do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LIFT team is urging Ethiopian policymakers to address this situation and help close a debilitating gap in land governance. Based on our research, we recommend that the following steps be taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endorse the articles on polygamous wives’ registration in the draft federal land proclamation that is currently under review. A study conducted by LIFT identified seven ways to register the land use rights of women in polygamous unions, of which we recommend two, based on their relative advantage in providing better security for all members in a polygamous household while minimising the risk of conflict between children and co-wives (see box). The decision regarding which option to adopt and implement would best be decided by the respective regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align procedures for polygamous households’ land registration with the binding judgement made by the Federal Supreme Court of Cassation, which ruled that although polygamy is illegal, its prevalence in Ethiopia means that all property should be divided equally between the husband and wives. Land certification should conform to this decision. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align procedures for polygamous households’ land registration with Article 34/4 of the Constitution, which has provision for polygamous marriages on cultural or religious grounds—despite prohibition by the Ethiopian criminal and family codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate into the design of land-related programmes a provision to support the registration of women’s land use rights in both monogamous and polygamous households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Options Proposed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Husband registers his share of the land with one wife. The rest of the wives register their own shares by themselves. First, the land is divided into equal parts, according to the number of wives (and includes the husband). The husband then chooses one wife to register with. The rest of the shares are owned only by the wives. For example, if a husband has three wives, the land is divided by four. The husband and one wife combine their shares to create a joint share. Each of the other wives has sole rights to a ¼ of the land. This option is thought to discourage polygamy, particularly because if the husband decides to take yet another wife, the new wife would become the preferred wife and the husband’s land share would shrink further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2:&lt;/strong&gt; All wives and the husband register separately. Every wife and the husband get an individual, equal share in their own names. In this option, everyone is separate and each person has rights to his or her own equal share of the land size. This option works when the husband has difficulty in choosing one of the wives as his joint landholder or when rivalry exists among the wives wishing to register with the husband as the joint holder.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polygamy is a challenging topic with cultural implications far beyond the land sector. But equally, LIFT’s work to enhance clarity, consistency, and understanding around women’s land rights in plural marriages offers an opportunity to achieve far-reaching impact. If we can embed good governance practice in all aspects of land rights registration, we will materially advance women’s land rights—with all that implies for women’s social and economic empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gathering the Evidence to Mobilize Domestic Resources for Health Care</title>

      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/marshaling-the-evidence-to-better-help-developing-countries-improve-and-afford-their-health-services</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two key areas of development assistance have been merging quickly: health care and domestic resource mobilization. The goal is to help developing countries &lt;em&gt;afford&lt;/em&gt; to invest in their national health systems and institutions and do so wisely. Many countries &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/long-term-fiscal-reform-takes-root-in-el-salvador-and-elsewhere/&quot;&gt;want to do more&lt;/a&gt; to fund their own development, and donors are on board to assist. But there is little evidence on how to do so effectively in the pursuit of greater health security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This knowledge gap prompted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-health-finance-and-governance&quot;&gt;Health Finance and Governance&lt;/a&gt; (HFG) project to conduct a four-part study, “Marshalling the Evidence for Health Governance,” funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Our technical working group analyzed data on how public financial management (PFM) affects health governance and produced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hfgproject.org/public-financial-management-report/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of our findings. Our HFG colleagues concurrently produced reports on the evidence as it applies to policy and regulation, uses of knowledge in health systems, and accountability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----DRM-Health-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----DRM-Health-1&quot; title=&quot;Winnie Koech, nurse, with a client at Tenwek Mission Hospital in Kenya. Koech graduated with assistance from the Afya Elimu Fund, an affordable loan mechanism developed by USAID, IntraHealth International, FUNZOKenya, and local governmental and private-sector partners.

&lt;p&gt;DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/when-tax-reform-leads-to-increased-funding-for-health-services/&quot;&gt;experience in El Salvador&lt;/a&gt; confirms that donor assistance in PFM can enable a country to provide more health services. Our HFG technical working group—which includes representatives from the World Health Organization, World Bank, Abt Associates, and DAI—set out to gather more evidence of what works, or not, in helping countries improve their health services; increase patients’ demand for, access to, and utilization of services; increase adoption of healthy behaviors; and protect people from debilitating health costs. In compiling this report, we also learned more about how health governance is evolving at the country level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Care Meets PFM in El Salvador&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three rounds of fiscal reform in El Salvador enabled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out-of-pocket health spending per capita to decrease from nearly $100 in 2003 to $61 in 2013, while government health spending per capita increased from $93 to $142.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government health spending to increase as a share of total health spending from less than 40 percent in 1995 to 67 percent in 2013.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citizens’ out-of-pocket spending from 1995 to 2013 to decrease from more than 60 percent to less than 30 percent of total health spending.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the key implications from the HFG report:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Three Ways to Increase Domestic Funding for Health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country policymakers can increase funding for health by 1) increasing tax revenues, 2) prioritizing health funding, and 3) increasing efficiency in health spending:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing tax revenues&lt;/strong&gt; through improved tax policy and collection is a proven winner among donor-funded programs. Our review of the evidence found that, as a proportion of gross domestic product, government tax revenue was significantly below its potential in many low- and middle-income countries. But that is a fixable state of affairs. USAID programs implemented by DAI, for instance, have increased domestic revenues in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/long-term-fiscal-reform-takes-root-in-el-salvador-and-elsewhere/&quot;&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/philippines-increases-tax-collections-by-11-billion-year-over-yearwithout-raising-rates/&quot;&gt;the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere. In these countries, PFM assistance led to reducing the cost and increasing the ease of tax compliance, reducing corruption by automating financial systems, and the adoption of enforcement approaches based on targeting areas at high risk for cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we found not all tax revenues to be equal when it comes to benefitting health funding. One multi-country study showed pro-poor taxes—such as on profits and capital gains—seemed to support expanding health coverage, while consumption taxes—such as on goods and services—reduced the ability of the poor to afford essential health care and were associated with increased rates of post-neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritizing health funding&lt;/strong&gt; helps ensure that increased government revenues lead to improved health care. Policy makers can champion this cause by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocating for policies that make the economic case for health in terms of impact on educational attainment, employment, and economic growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing budget planning and justifications that prioritize health financing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a tax fund specifically for health, such as dedicating a portion of tax revenues to health services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing taxes or fees earmarked for health, such as taxes on mobile phone calls, financial transactions, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralizing health spending to increase local pressure and accountability to fund health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the five emerging “BRICS” economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), total government spending on health is markedly less—from 8.1 to 12.7 percent—than in many countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which in 2016. The United States, for example, spent 17.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence is mixed in some areas of health reform—for example, in decentralization. In Ghana, a survey concluded that only 20 percent of the treasury&amp;rsquo;s non-wage public health expenditure reached frontline facilities. In Senegal, Health Decentralization Funds took 10 months on average to be at the disposal of providers. This suggests great vulnerability for leakage, but current data is woefully slim—the Ghana and Senegal surveys were from 2000 and 2004, respectively, highlighting the need to capture more—and more current—insights on how assistance would be best targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leakage of Recurrent Health Expenditures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leakage: theft, corruption, and misallocation or misuse of government/donor money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can occur at any point from the ministry of finance to the facility level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-salary recurrent expenditures include rent, office supplies, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing efficiency in health spending&lt;/strong&gt; requires planning, control, and oversight. The HFG report suggests fiscal reform actions that could help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium-term expenditure frameworks or multi-year sector budgeting plans can improve predictability in health funding and, consequently, the health sector’s ability to spend more productively and achieve results more predictably. Countries may also consider better yearly planning—looking at gaps in processes for collating and prioritizing health needs and allocating health funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated systems have been shown to improve control of expenditures. By introducing two interventions—an integrated financial management information system (IFMIS) and e-procurement—countries can reduce waste and fraud by increasing transparency and accountability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement is often a source of corruption and ineffective political spending. E-procurement can reduce fraud and waste and save money by reducing transaction costs as well as the cost of drugs, medical supplies, and other commodities. An IFMIS introduces greater control, transparency, and accountability into the expenditure process, reducing human error and corruption through a series of automated checks and controls enforced for all transactions. Although no research has been conducted on IFMIS’ effect on the health sector and health outcomes, it is a proven PFM intervention that raises the budget process to higher levels of transparency and accountability and expedites government operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counterfeit Drugs (estimated US$75 billion global market)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counterfeit: illegally imported or manufactured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside national laboratory or testing regimes; no way to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May not be drugs at all, may be expired, have altered formulas, or be genuine drugs illegally imported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can kill if people think they are taking genuine drugs but are not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can contribute to anti-microbial resistance when not strong enough to kill microbes.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----DRM-Health-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----DRM-Health-3&quot; title=&quot;Representatives of Haiti&amp;#39;s Health Directorate analyze data for a data quality workshop under USAID&amp;#39;s Strategic Health Information System Program, implemented by DAI.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making Health Spending More Accountable and Responsive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stewards of health systems and representatives of civil society, policy makers should take steps to improve oversight and accountability in health spending. To do so, they may also consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the analysis, visualization, and communication of health financing data to enhance understanding and use of that data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating reports to increase transparency and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing oversight via audit and reporting for better accountability within health systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralizing control of health procurement, services, and funding to local authorities to increase local accountability and responsiveness and create a tighter feedback loop for oversight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----DRM-Health-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----DRM-Health-2&quot; title=&quot;Midwife training in Afghanistan.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Knowledge Gaps That Need to be Filled&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of our technical working group searched 16 databases, websites, and organizations for articles and studies on the role of PFM in health systems and outcomes. We uncovered 165 articles, 46 of which were found to be fully relevant. Team members dissected the articles and extracted useful data for input into a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on PFM for health outcomes—especially current research—is lacking in several areas. For example, the team found no data on the role and effects on health systems of parliamentary oversight and the policy environment, of a Supreme Audit Institution, or of budget classification—such as removing duplicate line items, miscoding, and reducing the number of line items and off-budget transactions. More research is also needed on the effects of e-procurement, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://supplier.treasury.go.ke/site/tenders.go/index.php/pages/about&quot;&gt;procure-to-pay tool&lt;/a&gt; used in Kenya. As seen in one study, this tool is a good option for health system managers and procurement agencies to improve PFM and health outcomes simultaneously by increasing transparency and reducing corruption-enabling time lag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing countries make improved health outcomes a domestic development priority, they take the first necessary step toward &lt;em&gt;affording&lt;/em&gt; to pursue this goal. The next step—welcoming assistance in health and fiscal reform—puts the onus on the donor and implementer to get the assistance right. Looking ahead, we believe findings from this report and the others from “Marshalling the Evidence for Health Governance” mark a significant step forward in optimizing activities—and results—in health governance assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To Realize the Promise of Renewables, Address the Concerns of Local People</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/to-realize-the-promise-of-renewables-address-the-concerns-of-local-people</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2017 19:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Elizabeth Drachman</author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/to-realize-the-promise-of-renewables-address-the-concerns-of-local-people</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2009, in rural Pennsylvania, as head of the Renewable Energy Center, I attended a community meeting with the Army Corps of Engineers about a proposed wind farm in Ogletown, in Somerset County. I was told that previous meetings on the topic had been heated enough that a police presence was necessary—and welcomed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One by one, members of this small community expressed their fears. Some believed that wind turbines cause cancer. One person was afraid the blades would throw mercury. Another wondered if the turbines would kill local fish. Many believed wind turbines cause anxiety, headaches, cognitive issues, and emotional disturbances. Some stated that wind turbines cause epileptic seizures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall this experience to point out that aversion to change, hostility to potentially beneficial technology, and susceptibility to rumor—what we might in the current climate call “fake news”—is far from limited to the developing world. When people are angry, anxious, afraid, it becomes easier for them to believe what would otherwise seem outlandish, whether they live in central Pennsylvania or central America. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are proven ways to engage and bring on board these communities. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-ProParque-GEMA&quot;&gt;ProParque&lt;/a&gt; project and its experience introducing small hydro power to highland Honduran communities is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/waterfall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;waterfall&quot; title=&quot;Central Hidroeléctrica Río Blanco. The Pulhapanzak Waterfall is where the water originates.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2011 to 2016, ProParque was designed to conserve biodiversity, create jobs, and strengthen Honduras’ capacity for mitigating and adapting to climate change. As part of its natural resource protection mandate, ProParque began to promote small hydro. Most of the country’s electricity at that time was generated from diesel and oil, which for Honduras meant expensive electricity and exposure to price fluctuations. The Honduran government had pledged to reduce its dependence on imported oil and reverse its electricity generation mix from 60 percent oil and 40 percent renewables to 60 percent renewables and 40 percent oil. Between 2014 and 2015, it made headway toward this goal through a dramatic increase in solar and continued growth in hydro, wind, biomass, and waste. It now plans to have 95 percent of energy supplied from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2017/11/honduran-authorities-define-details-of-planned-hydroelectric-plants.html&quot;&gt;renewable sources&lt;/a&gt; by 2027. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is “small hydro”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Honduras, the environmental agency, MiAmbiente, classifies “small hydro” as 15 megawatts (MW)—enough to power a number of small villages—or less in generating capacity. Small hydro can be a dam or a run-of-the-river system that diverts a portion of the water to a generator while leaving the rest in the waterway. A run-of-the-river has significantly less impact on the ecosystem than a dam. Large hydro projects invariably involve at least some resettlement of people. Given its size, small hydro typically means faster construction, easier transport of equipment in remote areas, and less need for civil works construction. However, many Hondurans have failed to distinguish between small and large hydro, not realizing that small hydro projects—done properly—have relatively small environmental impact.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, increasing the proportion of energy generated by renewable sources means taking advantage of wind and hydro resources where they exist, not where it would be convenient for us to have them. And despite the potential for hydropower to support economic development—and the fact that distributed generation increases energy security locally and nationally—we encountered several barriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important was local opposition. Communities were afraid of large hydropower projects, and it was commonly believed that hydropower causes cancer and even abortions—concerns that extended even to smaller hydropower projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, two projects that would have provided 2.7 MW of power in the buffer zone of Nombre de Dios National Park were stopped because people in the communities in the watershed expected the project to pay them 40 percent of the plant revenue, even though they were only run-of-the-river and no resettlements were required. Two projects in the buffer zone of Sierra de Agalta National Park, that would have provided 8.9 MW, were stalled due to conflicts between the community and developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_f26c52a1-1c54-4d7b-bd12-7bf1be0b8a0c&quot; title=&quot;ProParque Results&quot; src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?qmS&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Informing the Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community acceptance of renewable energy plants is critical. Indeed, in most countries, including Honduras, consultations with local communities are not just good practice, they are legally required. Local involvement in the project development stage can result in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508003121&quot;&gt;greater acceptance&lt;/a&gt; and acceptance is easier when the communities are better informed. Especially in developing countries, communities often lack understanding of the technology, financing, or viability of electric power options, limiting their ability to negotiate with developers. ProParque tackled this constraint head on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, to improve the ability of civil society organizations to advocate and negotiate on their own behalf, ProParque produced a flip chart template and guide for teachers to develop educational campaigns about renewable energy. In addition, the team held workshops for 33 municipalities, seven government offices, three educational centers, and co-managers of national parks; and held 26 seminars on community education about renewable energy for 517 participants—196 of them women. Explaining hydro technology and projects in clear and simple terms, these materials equipped local schools and municipalities to lead their own educational programs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spreading the Word&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the U.S. Forestry Service, local nongovernmental groups, MiAmbiente, and the Honduran Association of Renewable Energy Producers, ProParque developed other materials that are beginning to gain traction in Honduras and beyond, including a Good Practices Guide, Lessons Learned in the Socialization Process, and Lessons Learned in the Socialization of Hydroelectric Projects—the latter building on the experience of several projects around protected areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Centre for Hydropower asked ProParque to share these materials and help the Nicaraguan Ministry of Energy and MiAmbiente develop a course on “Water Governance and Socio-Environmental Management for Hydroelectric Development in Latin America.” Held in Managua, the course attracted participants from Nicaragua and from neighboring Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. These materials have now been shared with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/Nepal-Program-for-Aquatic-Natural-Resources-Improvement-PANI&quot;&gt;Program for Aquatic Natural Resources Improvement (PANI)&lt;/a&gt;, another USAID program that is building the capacity of community groups to serve as watchdogs and ensure compliance with environmental and social obligations in Nepal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Community Benefits Are Key&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies in the United States, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837709000039&quot;&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511001972&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; have shown that attitudes toward wind power are more positive among people who derive financial benefit from the projects and in areas with some degree of community ownership of them. It is logical to assume that the same principle would apply to small hydro projects in Honduras and other developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, local communities benefit from power plant development through payments for land or land use, local direct employment, local indirect employment through supply chains, and an increased tax base. These benefits are harder to realize in countries where indigenous people lack clear title to land or the skills needed by project developers and operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly common for renewable energy projects to offer an explicit social benefit to communities to obtain their cooperation or at least mitigate their opposition. These separate and additional economic benefits range from ad hoc gifts—such as contributions to local sports programs—to legally binding annual payments. Social payments may in some countries be legally required to gain access to a resource. In Honduras, financial institutions will not lend to renewable energy projects absent such a social element. But developers recognize that these payments mitigate risk by encouraging local acceptance. Especially in projects that involve dams instead of run-of-the-river operations, communities perceive that adverse effects have been acknowledged and compensation provided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach gaining ground internationally is to give local community members an ownership stake in the projects. Projects that pay only those people with title to affected property tend to run into difficulties from aggrieved residents who didn’t receive such compensation. Projects that provide a one-time give away, such as a sports field, find that two years later their contribution is no longer remembered or valued. However, if a broader swathe of local people owns part of the development, those owners have a long-term interest in its success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/water%20tunnel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;water tunnel&quot; title=&quot;The local community has an ownership stake in Central Hidroeléctrica Río Blanco.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value transferred in the collective local ownership varies from project to project, of course, but it might be the equivalent of what a developer could spend on a donated sports field. The difference is that this stake represents a salable asset, perhaps one of the few assets local men and women have ever had. Perhaps this ownership stake increases their resilience in difficult times. If they receive dividends once the project hits profitability, they will have a small but additional income stream that will help offset any negative emotions about the development. 
Certifying the ownership stake individually, rather than by household, helps ensure that women benefit as well as men. 
Furthermore, making the community benefit an ownership stake instead of an initial gift aids the developer by postponing social payments from the risky, capital-intensive initial stage to the point when the plant is bringing in revenue in excess of its expenses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administering the benefits of such small ownership stakes may cost more than the benefits themselves, but the payback in community cooperation is worth it. Ongoing payments, even if small, generate trust and maintain a positive relationship between the community and the power plant which can head off or reduce potential confrontations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration and Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many countries, including Honduras and Nepal, forest areas are menaced by illegal logging, mining, and the expansion of agriculture. Small, sustainably managed renewable energy projects present an alternative that can improve the quality of life and bring new opportunities to local people, while preserving the watershed. But to deliver on this promise we need ongoing collaboration between developers and communities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ogletown, I regret to say, the wind farm still has not been built. The sponsoring company cancelled it in 2012. Over the course of the ProParque project, hydropower in Honduras increased from 149 MW in 2011 to 252 MW in &lt;a href=&quot;http://global-climatescope.org/en/country/honduras/#/enabling-framework&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;. The project worked directly with 21 stalled projects to get them through approvals by MiAmbiente. This success is due in large part to ProParque’s integrated  approach: informing communities, educating developers and government officials in best socialization practices, and delivering lasting benefits to local people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Orangutan Species Discovered in Forest  Supported by USAID Conservation Program</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/new-orangutan-species-discovered-in-forest-block-saved-by-usaid-conservation-program</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2017 16:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/new-orangutan-species-discovered-in-forest-block-saved-by-usaid-conservation-program</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than eight years ago, DAI staff tromped through the Batang Toru forest of North Sumatra, Indonesia, counting nests, observing behavior, and collecting field evidence on one of the oldest members of the great ape family—the orangutan. What they did not realize was that this group of orangutans was an entirely unrecognized species—the Tapanuli orangutan—that we now know is endemic to 475 square miles of upland forest in the Batang Toru Ecosystem south of Lake Toba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31245-9&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in the November 2, 2017, journal of &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, the Tapanuli orangutan is thought to have been isolated from the Bornean and Sumatran species for 10,000 to 20,000 years and is genetically and behaviorally distinct from both species. With a population of fewer than 800 individuals, the Tapanuli is considered the most endangered of all great apes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen width=&#39;640&#39; height=&#39;360&#39; src=&#39;//assets.nationalgeographic.com/modules-video/latest/assets/ngsEmbeddedVideo.html?guid=0000015f-7e0d-d63a-addf-fe9f93130000&#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; scrolling=&#39;no&#39;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, DAI was implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/indonesia-orangutan-conservation-services-program-ocsp&quot;&gt;Orangutan Conservation Services Program (OCSP)&lt;/a&gt; funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)—a program designed to address, reduce, or eliminate threats to orangutan survival in selected sites in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). The primary threat to orangutans is loss of habitat—over the past 20 years, 80 percent of suitable orangutan habitat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orangutans.com.au/Orangutans-Survival-Information/Loss-of-habitat.aspx&quot;&gt;has been lost&lt;/a&gt;. A decade ago, USAID recognized the imminent danger of orangutan species extinction and pledged to work with the government of Indonesia to address the primary drivers of habitat loss—illegal logging and the conversion of forest to produce oil palm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Balancing Conservation and Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2007, the OCSP team worked in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.batangtoru.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Location_20171101_ENG_NoOU_B.jpg&quot;&gt;West Batang Toru Forest Block (WBTFB)&lt;/a&gt;—covering the South, Central, and North Tapanuli districts—to bring together district officials, local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and community leaders and develop an &lt;em&gt;action plan&lt;/em&gt; to preserve orangutan habitat. DAI used techniques including integrated spatial planning and weaving together “multifunctional landscapes” that balance economic land use—such as production forestry and oil palm plantations—with maintaining corridors of intact orangutan habitat. As part of the design, the OCSP Sumatra regional office—led by Darrell Kitchener and Pahrian Siregar—surveyed a population of around 380 orangutan individuals in WBTFB, the remote group that was recently identified as the Tapanuli species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----OCSP-4-closeup.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----OCSP-4-closeup&quot; title=&quot;Photo by Andrew Watson/DAI.&quot;&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCSP also worked with local NGOs to develop a spatial plan to restore forest corridors and reduce tree removal from water catchment zones critical for maintaining ecological flows and supporting local communities in and around the orangutan habitat. With support from all three district governments, OCSP and local NGOs successfully petitioned the government to reclassify WBTFB as watershed protection forest, a critical first step in protecting this vital orangutan habitat. Work continues today to limit the forest fragmentation in the ecosystem and reestablish corridors for the Tapanuli orangutans, which rely on continuous forest canopy to survive. Today approximately 800 Tapanuli orangutan live in the Batang Forest ecosystem, and without continued and careful conservation management, per the studies’ authors, we could see the extinction of the species in our lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orangutan Conservation Services Program Select Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented conservation activities in 3.5 million hectares, covering 40 percent of Indonesia’s orangutan habitat, and improving the management of 1.3 million hectares critical for orangutans and other globally important species.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convened key actors to provide input into the Ministry of Forestry’s National Orangutan Strategy and Action Plan 2007–2017, which was announced by the Indonesian President at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali in 2007, and commits the Indonesian government to stabilizing all orangutan populations by 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A key victory in East Kalimantan, photo below, saw the indigenous Dayak people of Wehea awarded Indonesia’s highest environmental honor for protecting and managing 38,000 hectares of rainforest from lowland to mountain. The area—an important water and medicinal plant source for the Wehea people and home to 500 to 750 orangutans—was declared protected by the local government, which helped fund its management while private firms helped fund infrastructure.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----OCSP2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----OCSP2&quot; title=&quot;In East Kalimantan, the indigenous Dayak people of Wehea were awarded Indonesia’s highest environmental honor for protecting and managing 38,000 hectares of rainforest, home to 500 to 750 orangutans.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Investing Time to Ensure Local Ownership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We suspected that the orangutan inhabiting the Batang Toru forests might be a different sub-species than those in the Leuser ecosystem to the north,” said former OCSP Chief of Party Paul Hartman. “But that this has been found to be an entirely new species is both surprising and exciting. With this extraordinary find it is now critical to ensure the survival of this most threatened orangutan species.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent article in Current Biology brought a sense of pride and excitement to DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/environment-and-energy&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/a&gt; team. “Our work often fits within three- to five-year contracts, yet generating results often takes time beyond the end of the project cycle,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/andrew-watson&quot;&gt;Andrew Watson&lt;/a&gt;, the team’s managing director. “When work that began with OCSP in 2007 has contributed to a major scientific discovery in 2017, we realize that the time and patience our teams invest in ensuring local ownership of conservation programming is all worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key members of our OCSP team are now on the frontlines of orangutan conservation in the region. DAI’s Sumatra Regional Coordinator Pahrian Siregar went on to earn his Ph.D. in environmental science with a focus on landscape management of orangutan habitat; Field Scientist Dr. Suci Atmoko is a candidate for the 2018 Indianapolis Prize for animal conservation; and our Deputy Chief of Party, Dr. Jamartin Sihite, currently serves as the CEO for the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, one of the most prominent international NGOs focused on orangutan rehabilitation and forest release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this new species discovery is a landmark event for the 21st century, it is also a call to action to protect the high-elevation forest in Batang Toru. Plans to develop a hydropower dam on the nearby Batang Toru river and encroachment by palm oil plantations continue to threaten this critical orangutan habitat. DAI is confident that leading Indonesian conservation experts, including our project alumni, will continue to champion orangutan habitat protection so that our generation is not responsible for the extinction of one of our oldest ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EU Funds Totaling €4.1 Billion Aim to Boost Investment, Private Sector Engagement in Africa and European Neighbourhood Countries</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/eu-launches-26-billion-fund-to-attract-investment-in-the-european-neighbourhood-and-africas-fragile-states</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2017 19:38:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/eu-launches-26-billion-fund-to-attract-investment-in-the-european-neighbourhood-and-africas-fragile-states</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowhere do entrepreneurs and investors face more risk than in fragile states where jobs and economic growth are most needed. To mitigate this risk, the EU is launching the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), part of the External Investment Plan (EIP). The EFSD brings together €2.6 billion from the existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/policies/innovative-financial-instruments-blending/blending-operations_en&quot;&gt;blended-finance operations&lt;/a&gt; in Africa and the European Neighbourhood region and the new guarantee for €1.5 billion. The EIP will be formally announced at the 6th African-EU Business Forum 27–28 November in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EIP represents a new approach to development aid. Funds will be managed through partner lending institutions in target countries, overseen by the Brussels-based Secretariat of the EIP. This reduced-risk financing is projected to generate &lt;em&gt;tens of billions&lt;/em&gt; of euros in additional public and private capital investment and guarantees from businesses and EU Member States in the coming years. DAI is assisting in key areas of the investment strategy through its management of the EU-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-trade-private-sector-development-and-engagement-and-regional-integration-facility&quot;&gt;Trade, Private Sector Development and Engagement (TPSD/E) Facility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DEVS----EIP-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DEVS----EIP-4&quot; title=&quot;Port of Mombasa, Kenya.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund aims to stimulate growth in some of the world’s most investment-starved markets, such as the Central African Republic, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in the EU Neighbourhood countries. Along with their chronic instability, these and other fragile states have something else in common: growing populations that need goods, services, and jobs. The EIP will make it easier for local businesspeople to show their entrepreneurial energy, and for external parties to invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to local financing, the EIP will support risk-reduced, market-targeted investments in these countries. With more than half the world’s foreign assistance provided by the EU and its Member States, the EIP has enormous potential to generate growth in developing economies and influence new approaches by assistance donors, including in the emerging area of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-development-assistance-to-catalyze-sound-investments-in-emerging-and-developing-markets/&quot;&gt;blended finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0__/wT6B85nAU0m924g72Gmx&quot; title=&quot;TSPD EIP Final&quot; src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed.js?KmO&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Serving Africa&amp;rsquo;s, EU Neighbourhood&amp;rsquo;s Hungry Markets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite strong economic gains in certain countries, the African continent has seen minimal job growth in recent years due largely to poor business-enabling environments, limited financing opportunities, and the fragility that tends to deter investors. The resulting high unemployment drives further instability and migration within Africa and to Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This downward investment trend is derived in part from a global decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) following the 2008 financial crisis. Coupled with simmering conflict in multiple African countries, this dip has led to decelerating economic growth across the continent. While African gross domestic product grew at an average of 5.4 percent annually from 2000 to 2015, it has since slowed to 3.3 percent. The stagnation in FDI has disproportionately affected Africa’s fragile states, which face the additional disadvantage of higher costs to establish a business—it is three times more costly to set up a business in Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, than in more developed African nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the lack of viable employment opportunities in many African countries has driven an unprecedented number of migrants to attempt dangerous journeys to Europe by sea and land. In the long term, the population on the African continent is expected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/world-population-prospects-the-2017-revision.html&quot;&gt;double by 2050&lt;/a&gt; and fuel increasing demand for jobs, goods, and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many European Neighbourhood countries suffer from sluggish growth, high unemployment (especially among young people), low employment participation by women and young people, below-average FDI, and rising public debt. Some countries have endured periods of civil unrest or conflicts that have damaged the region’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU Neighbourhood countries also face underdeveloped infrastructure, poor human capital development, weak competition in internal goods and services markets, lagging digital economy development, and above all, weak business environments that present obstacles to growth and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----EIP-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----EIP-3&quot; title=&quot;Young men in Morocco awaiting a ride to their agricultural jobs.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Approach to Market Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address Africa’s growing population as well as market needs in the European Neighbourhood, the EU recognizes that it needs to look beyond traditional development grants. The EIP represents a new approach—an overarching framework that seeks to bring together international financial institutions, donor agencies, and the private sector in a coherent market systems strategy. The strategy will be driven by demand for reduced-risk financing and investing to fill growing demand in fragile states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EIP comprises three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobilizing Investments&lt;/strong&gt;—the guarantee and blended-finance operations will de-risk investments and attract public and private investors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Providing Technical Assistance&lt;/strong&gt;—support to develop new investment projects and local investment climate reform projects; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Investment Climate&lt;/strong&gt;—engaging with the private sector and improving policies around local business environments should lead to a favourable and conducive investment climate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early 2017, DAI has assisted the European Commission’s International Development Cooperation Directorate through the TPSD/E Facility, which delivers thematic support, policy advice, knowledge management, and communications expertise on issues related to trade and private sector development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the EU Delegations in the implementation of this new investment-focused approach, the TPSD/E Facility will assist in identifying country-specific opportunities for business reform. EU Delegations may request Investment Climate Reform diagnostics toolkits and related training, which will initially address five investment windows: access to finance, renewable energy, agribusiness, smart cities, and digitalisation. To promote the availability of funds and enhance awareness of the EIP, the TPSD/E team have created an online learning module, “EIP in Practice,” on the EU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://europa.eu/capacity4dev/&quot;&gt;Capacity4Dev platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----EIP-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----EIP-2&quot; title=&quot;mPesa branchless banking started in 2007 in Kenya and Tanzania and has expanded abroad.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TPSD/E facility will also advise EU Delegations on how best to implement the EIP. For example, it will help Delegations identify investment opportunities that support small businesses and sole proprietors, which provide most of the jobs in Africa yet often have no access to financing to grow their operations. The EIP is the EU’s first investment plan outside Europe to tackle investment constraints on such a wide scale. With its focus on investment and guarantees, the EIP can target sectors conducive to development—such as infrastructure, energy, water, and information technology—and support specific Sustainable Development Goals, such as jobs for women and youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this type of private-sector engagement may be new to many EU Delegation staff, the TPSD/E team will support public-private structured dialogue within the context of investment climate reform. The team has already mapped out the major business intermediary organisations in 49 African countries. This support and mapping will assist both local companies seeking new market linkages and European companies seeking to enter new and emerging markets. Delegations will also help advocate for business and investment reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----EIP-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----EIP-5&quot; title=&quot;Sub-Saharan Africa is becoming a key sourcing destination for global apparel buyers. This includes Kenyan apparel producer UAL, which has received assistance from the USAID East Africa Trade and Investment Hub, implemented by DAI.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Providing One-Stop Shop Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EIP Secretariat in Brussels will provide one-stop shop services to those seeking to invest in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Eastern and Southern European Neighbourhoods, especially the fragile states. In bolstering small and growing businesses in these countries, the aim is to stimulate additional investment by the EU, local businesses, and financial institutions as part of an integrated financial value chain. DAI looks forward to playing an instrumental role in supporting the implementation of the EIP.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Q&amp;A with DAI’s Susan Scribner: Preparedness, Response, and Global Health Security</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/qa-with-dais-susan-scribner-about-preparedness-response-and-global-health-security</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/qa-with-dais-susan-scribner-about-preparedness-response-and-global-health-security</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pandemics begin with a single case but don’t stay that way: since 2000, avian influenza has killed 440 people in 14 countries, Ebola more than 11,000 people in 10 countries, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 770 people in 37 countries. The first deaths were reported locally in Hong Kong (1997), Guinea (2013), and China (2002), respectively. HIV/AIDS was first contracted by a human from a primate in West Africa—since 1981, AIDS has killed 35 million people, including 675,000 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These crises galvanized the U.S. government to enact programs to help at-risk countries contain emerging diseases, and these programs are working. For example, programs funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by DAI, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-stamping-out-pandemic-and-avian-influenza-stop-ai&quot;&gt;STOP AI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-respond&quot;&gt;RESPOND&lt;/a&gt; programs, were credited with limiting the spread of avian influenza and substantially strengthening outbreak response capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, USAID doubled down on this work in global health security, launching the Emerging Pandemic Threats-2 suite of programs. The EPT-2 suite includes the DAI-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-preparedness-and-response-pr&quot;&gt;Preparedness &amp;amp; Response (P&amp;amp;R)&lt;/a&gt; program team, working in target countries to strengthen national systems in the prevention, detection, and response to emerging pandemic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project uses the One Health approach—the combined efforts of the human health, animal health, and environmental sectors—to reduce time to detection and confirmation of public health events. Developments asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/susan-scribner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAI’s Susan Scribner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, below, P&amp;amp;R’s Project Director and Vice President of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/health&quot;&gt;DAI Global Health&lt;/a&gt;, about this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Scribner-pic-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Scribner-pic-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIDS, Ebola, others … what causes a pandemic-threat disease and what factors cause them to spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were zoonotic diseases—diseases that happen when a pathogen from an animal spreads to humans. Increasingly, we’re finding human intrusion into animal ecosystems, increased animal-based food production, growing international trade, and expanding international travel have increased the opportunity for “spillover” into human populations. There are 7.5 billion people on this planet, with increasing global travel. Human beings are more mobile than ever—which means pathogens are, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R works with international partners to help governments in 15 countries—why were these countries targeted for USAID investment preventing, detecting, responding to, and containing emerging pandemic threats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are countries at high risk. They have a history of disease outbreaks, warm climates, and growing human populations that have been encroaching on wildlife areas. Some countries may also lack a health-systems infrastructure, which makes them more vulnerable to these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Scribner-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Scribner-4&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the tipping point that prompted this response—both the global health security effort and the Preparedness &amp;amp; Response program in particular?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international community has spent an enormous amount of time and money over the years reacting to HIV, Ebola virus disease, and avian influenza, to name a few. When it comes to health security, loss of lives, and economic and societal disruption, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot afford to just respond to pandemic threats anymore; we need to be proactive about preventing them. That means working to improve country government systems and planning for preparedness and response, which is where P&amp;amp;R sits. By focusing on systems and planning, the P&amp;amp;R program helps bridge the gap between traditional health-systems strengthening activities and specific global health security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P&amp;amp;R Target Countries:&lt;/strong&gt; Bangladesh, Cameroon, Cote D&amp;#39; Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Vietnam.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the &lt;a href=&quot;http://preparednessandresponse.org/&quot;&gt;P&amp;amp;R project&lt;/a&gt; strengthen systems and planning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project uses the One Health approach to ensure that national systems and plans bring the right resources to the table. That means medical doctors working with veterinarians, local health care providers working with emergency responders, the private sector working with the public sector. The multisectoral coordination mechanism that makes this possible is what we call a One Health platform, which we are developing in each of the 15 countries where we work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A One Health platform coordinates implementation of a variety of prevention, detection, and response activities to pandemic threats for the country government—everything from prioritizing zoonotic diseases or drafting a One Health strategy with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to integrating disease surveillance, to multisectoral planning and rapid response training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;amp;R helps launch and strengthen One Health platforms. We also work with established platforms, local stakeholders, and multilateral partners to help them implement preparedness and response activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Scribner-4-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Scribner-4-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Ebola countries—Liberia and Sierra Leone, where 8,700 people died—recently “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/health/5758-liberia-partners-institutionalize-one-health-approach-in-liberia&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt;” their One Health platforms. What does that mean in practical terms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means the country is committed to supporting the One Health approach and addressing global health security, and they’ve put the systems and people in place to do it. But formalizing their One Health platforms is just the first step. These countries need to review and test their plans and the specific protocols and operating procedures that outline how the human, animal, and environmental health sectors will work together in different scenarios. They need to strengthen the relevant workforce, surveillance systems, and laboratory capacity to prevent, detect, and respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been great examples of the power of the One Health platforms already, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://bdnews24.com/health/2017/09/17/one-health-concept-important-for-bangladesh-who-representative&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;’s and Uganda’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/healthprotection/fieldupdates/summer-2017/uganda-avian-influenza.html&quot;&gt;avian influenza responses&lt;/a&gt; and Uganda’s recent Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the Ebola outbreak of 2014—the same year P&amp;amp;R was launched—teach us anything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it taught us the importance of building a strong preparedness and response infrastructure during “peace time,” before the next outbreak strikes. It also highlighted the need to broaden the One Health community to include stakeholders in immigration, security, education, commerce, and the private sector—which can be a particularly important partner for mobilizing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are typical challenges to creating One Health platforms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many countries, health ministries are stronger and better resourced than the other sectors. This inequity extends beyond funding—animal health and environment sectors also tend to have weaker surveillance data and human resource capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working with the platforms to address some of these limitations, by improving the practice of One Health—coordinating advocacy, resource mobilization, strategy, planning, training, data sharing, surveillance, and rapid response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Scribner-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Scribner-2&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are next steps for P&amp;amp;R—and for global health security—in continuing to improve prevention, detection, and response?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our project and the One Health platforms we support move closer to accomplishing their planning and strategy objectives, training and guidance will take on a larger role in effective implementation. So we are looking at developing planning guidance for provincial and district implementation, as we’ve done in Indonesia. Recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/one-health-workforce/one-health-central-and-eastern-africa-network-officially-launched-in-cameroon-29eec092a774&quot;&gt;in Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, we supported platform training for district-level emergency operations centers; we have also trained Rapid Response Teams for the West African Health Organization (WAHO) at the regional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because so many improvements will need to be made at the subnational level, it is essential to build a network of One Health technical specialists. This is the network of doctors, epidemiologists, public health specialists, veterinarians, and environmental experts that DAI has spent the past 20 years developing, not just on P&amp;amp;R but also on the Stop AI and RESPOND projects before it, and several earlier bilateral projects in Indonesia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, P&amp;amp;R has also spent significant time in defining and simplifying technical guidance to the One Health approach. Our upcoming project technical guide includes a series of activity toolkits—toolkits the project is developing with feedback from both international and country government partners—that will make it easier for country platforms to implement these activities themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the global health security community has made so much progress in the past 10 years. But we are going to have to continue to do more to leverage the resources we have from both international and country government partners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sourcing the Wadi: How Palestinian Workers Are Filling Niche Needs in Israel’s IT Sector</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/sourcing-the-wadi-training-palestinian-workers-to-fill-niche-need-in-israel-it</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2017 18:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/sourcing-the-wadi-training-palestinian-workers-to-fill-niche-need-in-israel-it</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Middle East hosts one of the fastest-growing high-tech industries in the world: Israel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/israels-high-tech-sector-is-thriving-and-now-china-wants-in-on-the-action.html&quot;&gt;Silicon Wadi&lt;/a&gt;. But the very speed of this growth means Israel’s tech sector also faces a shortage of skilled engineers. To deal with this shortage, Israel has turned largely to Eastern Europe as a source for IT workers. Though there is plenty of talent in Eastern Europe, the time difference is not ideal for collaborating and that talent is becoming costlier as global demand increases. This combination of circumstances means opportunities for Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/palestinian-market-development-programme-pmdp&quot;&gt;Palestinian Market Development Programme (PMDP)&lt;/a&gt; has seized upon this need by shifting Silicon Wadi’s sourcing focus close to home—to Palestinian IT firms. Funded by the U.K. Department for International Development and the European Commission, and in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portlandtrust.org/&quot;&gt;Portland Trust&lt;/a&gt;, PMDP identified the verification of software for microchips—or design verification—as a niche area of demand that fits wells with emerging Palestinian service capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Mira-Nasser-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Mira-Nasser-3&quot; title=&quot;The software engineer team at ProGineer in Ramallah that won a subcontract to provide design verification.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on business and workforce development, PMDP&amp;rsquo;s approach is beginning to pay off. A team of five software engineers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.progineer.net/&quot;&gt;ProGineer&lt;/a&gt; in Ramallah recently won a subcontract to provide design verification for a multinational firm. The competitive award is a breakthrough for the Palestinian IT sector and showcases its ability to provide services to international clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Design Verification?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global advances in computer hardware have forced semiconductor design to become more sophisticated. Higher-performing microchips utilize increasingly complex semiconductor designs, and this has spawned an entire industry specializing in design testing to increase performance and production efficiency. Israel—home to companies such as Intel, Cadence, Mellannox—is a world leader in design verification technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Palestinian Market Development Programme (PMDP)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMDP improves market systems and competitiveness in the Palestinian private sector through technical assistance and matching grants. It addresses market system failures in specific sectors through market analysis and facilitation, and strengthens trade and investment linkages in collaboration with key commercial representatives. In the West Bank, the program has assisted more than 360 businesses (including 98 women-owned) with targeted grants, developing or enhancing more than 460 new products while helping nearly 200 businesses and increasing sales by £33 million. In Gaza, PMDP has assisted more than 260 businesses and helped develop or enhance 130 new products, increasing sales by £55.7 million and creating more than 1,600 jobs.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Choose Palestinian Companies?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer look at the market opportunity revealed certain factors advantageous to Palestinian firms, including physical proximity to clients in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (allowing for same time-zone operation and local travel), lower costs than in Israel, and similar costs to Eastern Europe. While the market opportunity was clear, the Palestinian market  remained undertested for design and verification services; prior to this engagement, only one service contract was being implemented by a Palestinian IT firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinian IT firms have two factors working against them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak links and lack of awareness of business opportunities with multinational companies in the region; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited local opportunities to gain experience and professional training in design verification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/DEVS----Mira-Nasser-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DEVS----Mira-Nasser-2&quot; title=&quot;Design-verification training under the Palestinian Market Development Programme included technical and practical components.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Palestinian value proposition was presented to Israel-based multinational companies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cadence.com/&quot;&gt;Cadence&lt;/a&gt;, a provider of system design tools and software, expressed strong interest. Based upon this reaction, PMDP and The Portland Trust teams designed a three-stage intervention—applying DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/new-primer-market-systems-development-available&quot;&gt;principles of market systems development&lt;/a&gt;—aimed at stimulating commercial transactions between Cadence and Palestinian providers: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the waters:&lt;/strong&gt; Portland Trust asked Cadence to outline its service requirements and agree to a three-month “mock project” to test Palestinian capabilities. Four local Palestinian firms—Exalt, Progineer, Unit One, Appstown—put together teams of five members each to complete the test project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training time:&lt;/strong&gt; A one-month, in-classroom training in system-design skills and testing software was delivered by a leading provider, Variest. The four Palestinian companies nominated 18 staff members to be trained. Feedback from the training was encouraging, with most of the participants scoring well on the end-of-course exam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mock projects:&lt;/strong&gt; Following evaluation of the training, Cadence invited two teams to enroll in mock projects involving a live design-verification challenge. Eleven engineers from two shortlisted teams participated in the projects remotely over three months, with weekly visits to the Cadence campus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Deal is Struck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impressed by the mock project performance, Cadence extended its agreement to Progineer, creating five high-quality, full-time jobs—one team leader and four junior programmers—in Ramallah. This purely commercial engagement is a breakthrough for the Palestinian IT outsourcing industry. It proves the business value that Palestinian service providers can deliver to international clients, and showcases a model for how IT outsourcing can grow through effective structuring of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Mira-Nasser-IT-PMDP-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Mira-Nasser-IT-PMDP-1&quot; title=&quot;Group photo of the design-verification trainees under the Palestinian Market Development Programme.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable growth of the design-verification service line hinges upon Progineer successfully delivering results to Cadence and expanding to serve additional clients. Meanwhile, the other Palestinian firms—Exalt, Unit One, and Appstown—also have potential to tap market opportunities after taking design-verification training. “As awareness of Palestinian design-verification capabilities grows, there will be more interest from buyers, and local business development capabilities will grow stronger,” said PMDP Team Leader Maher Hamdan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMDP plans to nuture this interest by supporting the growth of existing services, fostering additional business connections, and making design-verification training locally available. The team also plans to work with Palestinian universities to introduce design-verification courses to the IT curricula to further stimulate a generation of marketable IT employees.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turning Restrictive Social Norms in the Middle East into Job Opportunities for Women</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/turning-social-norms-in-the-middle-east-into-job-opportunities-for-women</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 10:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/turning-social-norms-in-the-middle-east-into-job-opportunities-for-women</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When deep-rooted social norms appear to limit the roles of women, one of the best tactics we can take in development assistance is to look for opportunities to turn those norms to women&amp;rsquo;s advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent example is in the Middle East, where our U.K. Department for International Development-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/jordan-egypt-and-palestine-arab-women-enterprise-fund&quot;&gt;Arab Women’s Enterprise Fund&lt;/a&gt; (AWEF) is assisting female-led value chains. In Palestine, AWEF is working with female sheep herders in rural areas to train these women as paraveterinary workers. A paravet functions like a veterinary assistant, nurse, or animal technician by providing basic but important treatment and testing for herds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestine has approximately 30,000 sheep herds, with an estimated 25,000 women playing active roles in their operation, especially among small herds of 35 or fewer animals. But AWEF’s analysis shows that the women-led herds suffer close to 30 percent productivity loss due to poor vaccinations and inadequate animal health care. Because most veterinarians are male, and gender mixing is discouraged, female herders cannot partake in veterinary services provided by men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_0039.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0039&quot; title=&quot;A female paravet tending to her herd in Palestine.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Training a Cadre of Female Paravets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seizing the opportunity inherent in this restricted market, AWEF and its partners are training a cadre of 20 female paravets to provide much-needed services. These services improve the health of female-led herds as well as the incomes of the herders. Additionally, the female paravets are gaining the respect of their communities, earning more money for their families, and acting as role models for other women. By interacting directly with female paravets, Palestine’s women herders are learning about animal health care and improving their skills, instead of relying on their husbands or other men in their families who are too often ill-informed on herd health needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, women rarely held authority to make decisions around this family business. Social norms constrained their interactions with veterinarians, traders, and the male-dominant herding community. But as women paravets increase their services, it is anticipated that female herders will assume a greater sense of ownership and commitment to their traditionally unpaid work. Eventually, female herders will increase their capacity to manage herds and improve women’s overall role in livestock management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men in these communities will also benefit because female paravets’ services will add to household incomes while reducing or eliminating the expense of seeking assistance from veterinarians, whose clinics are often located far away from small villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWEF Disadvantaged Assessment Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWEF is the only market systems development project in the region with women’s economic empowerment as its core objective. The AWEF team developed and is now rolling out a gender-sensitive poverty mapping tool called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seepnetwork.org/empowerment-forward-poverty-measurement--real-time-learning-from-the-arab-women---s-enterprise-fund---s-disadvantage-assessment-resources-1778.php&quot;&gt;Disadvantaged Assessment&lt;/a&gt;, designed to identify areas in market systems where women’s disadvantages hinder their ability to find jobs or develop livelihoods. While the tool has yet to be fully implemented, its early findings in Palestine reveal that women are disadvantaged due to their high amount of time spent performing unpaid work, lack of decision-making authority around mobility, poor economic standing, and exposure to physical violence. In the coming months, the AWEF team will begin performing Disadvantaged Assessments on target locales and sectors.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Extending Herd-Care Services in Afghanistan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training women as paravets is also bearing fruit in other DAI-led projects. The U.S. Agency for International Development-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-regional-agricultural-development-program-radp-north&quot;&gt;Regional Agricultural Development Program-North&lt;/a&gt; (RADP-North), for example, trained 15 paravets (10 men, five women) in 2016, filling an important need for livestock owners. Trainees were equipped with tools and equipment to establish veterinary field units in the communities they now serve. RADP-North is on schedule to train another 20 paravets through 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of RADP-North’s female trainees, Fatima, provides veterinary services to more than 500 farmers in 12 surrounding villages—encompassing more than 2,000 animals—while earning AFN 600 to 800 per day. “Recently, a woman called me and said that she had a newborn calf that was sick,” Fatima said. “I traveled to the area, checked the calf, and found that the calf was highly dehydrated due to acute diarrhea. The woman was so concerned about losing the calf, but I medicated the calf by injecting some vitamins, and within an hour, the calf began to improve. The woman was so happy and thanked me for saving her calf.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/IMG_8165.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_8165&quot; title=&quot;Aya Mletat started her sheep farm when she was just 20.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Earning Acceptance Among Men&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Palestine, Aya Mletat, a 30-year-old mother of two, established her own sheep farm at age 20. Today, Mletat trains and mentors both male and female herders in her community. According to Mletat, men who refused to deal with her at first have now accepted her consultations after seeing her paraveterinary skills in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWEF is finding opportunities within a culture of “constraints” in other Middle Eastern countries. In Jordan, AWEF is training women who run dairy-processing outfits to meet the standards required for local regulatory certification of their dried yogurt. This training helps these female-led small businesses to improve the quality of their products and increase sales in male-dominated markets. In Egypt, AWEF is teaching large businesses in the garment and citrus sectors to recruit women for positions—including senior and management roles—where the work and interactions would be culturally permissable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/nandi-hall&quot;&gt;Nandi Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the AWEF project director, said the team’s underlying goal is to identify social norms that open windows of opportunities for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“AWEF believes that social norms can shift when people begin to experience the economic benefits of new behaviours,” Hall said. “We hope to provide the opportunity for other women in traditional roles to be more encouraged to explore new roles by viewing social norms in a new light.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Helping Eastern Partnership Countries Meet Their Commitments to Address Climate Change</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/helping-eastern-partnership-countries-meet-their-voluntary-commitments-to-reduce-emissions-address-climate-change</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2017 14:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/helping-eastern-partnership-countries-meet-their-voluntary-commitments-to-reduce-emissions-address-climate-change</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The economies of Eastern Europe have grown in recent decades largely on the backs of heavy industry, mechanisation, and agriculture. In many countries, this has led to significant greenhouse gas emissions, a reliance on inefficient technologies, and a policy environment that did not support green growth. As part of their commitments to global climate change agreements, signatory countries pledged to reduce emissions. After committing to cleaner ways, however, these countries faced a common challenge: where to start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the six countries of the European Union’s Eastern Partnership now has a plan. Under Clima East, a 4½-year programme funded by the European Commission and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/russian-federation-clima-east-support-climate-change-mitigation-and-adaptation&quot;&gt;implemented by DAI&lt;/a&gt;, the countries—Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine—assessed how to best reduce emissions and adapt their industries, agriculture, and households to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, this planning was well timed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.climaeast.eu/&quot;&gt;Clima East&lt;/a&gt; originally launched in 2012 to continue support of the Kyoto climate agreements from 15 years earlier. But the Clima East team pivoted when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) announced that participants of the 2016 Paris Conference would need to draft and submit, in advance, their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). The team was well placed to support the development of these INDCs and ensure they were technically sound and suitably ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Clima-East-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Clima-East-2&quot; title=&quot;In Azerbaijan, Clima East introduced techniques that reduce emissions of carbon and incentivize farmers to control animal numbers for better soil conditions and biodiversity. Credit: Clima East.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Eastern Partnership nations are prepared to address and, over time, meet their Paris commitments to consume less energy, reduce emissions, and increase use of energy from renewable sources. They are also prepared to put strategies in place to support adaptation to a changing climate across a range of core economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clima East’s holistic approach to supporting these partner nations produced an array of results for each country. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Armenia&lt;/strong&gt;, the country’s Environmental Project Implementation Unit was accredited to access and implement funding from a major source—the global Adaptation Fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/strong&gt;, gaps in the country’s land use, land-use change, and forestry inventory were identified and recommendations made on steps to improve local stakeholders’ capacities in this key area of greenhouse gas reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Belarus&lt;/strong&gt;, more than 200 people across 20 ministries, agencies, and other organisations were engaged and informed about international climate adaptation and mitigation best practices, including for planning agriculture adaptation and for obligations and opportunities under the Paris Agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt;, roadmaps were produced to align with EU legislation in fluorinated gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons, and other ozone-depleting substances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Moldova&lt;/strong&gt;, civil society organisations were engaged in the crucial policy processes under way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, backlogged requests for improvements made by UNFCCC reviewers were addressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brochure describing Clima East&amp;rsquo;s broader results is available here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1067656943.n159491.test.prositehosting.co.uk/wp-content-sec/uploads/2013/08/Clima-East-Final-Brochure-2017-PDF.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Clima-East-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Clima-East-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Supporting Preparations to Honor Commitments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe and its eastern neighbors are increasingly affected by rising global temperatures related to climate change. The World Bank, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/676601468249642651/pdf/761840PUB0EPI00LIC00pubdate03015013.pdf&quot;&gt;forecasts&lt;/a&gt; fluctuations in crop growing conditions by 2050 that will be especially difficult for small, poorer farms in the region to address. More frequent, more severe floods, droughts, and heatwaves are expected to affect industry, agriculture, and, ultimately, public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern Partnership nations acknowledged their increasing emissions of greenhouse gases in signing the Paris Agreement and resolved to significantly reduce their own emissions from 2020 forward. Before they signed the agreement, Clima East assisted Eastern Partnership countries in developing their INDCs. Equipped with these feasible goals, policy makers set out to develop plans on where and how their country could cut emissions, but the region’s climate scientists and lawmakers lacked the data and analytical tools needed to create accurate models of how to meet their commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clima East team and their ministerial counterparts analyzed leading emitters of greenhouse gases and identified ways to reduce emissions in sectors such as energy, agriculture, forestry, transport, waste, construction, and manufacturing. In Azerbaijan, for example, the counterparts achieved consensus on projections and created scenarios covering industrial processes, urban planning, and reforestation of degraded land. As a result, the government of Azerbaijan was able to submit its INDC ahead of Paris and set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent from the country’s 1990 level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, policy makers in Belarus identified the need for specialized advice, and with Clima East&amp;rsquo;s assistance they were able to examine data and create a model that revealed untapped options for reducing greenhouse gases. With these new insights, Belarus increased its INDC emission-reduction goal from 25 percent to 28 percent of 1990 levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Clima-East-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Clima-East-4&quot; title=&quot;Regional workshop in Baku, Azerbaijan, about modelling tools for vulnerability assessments in the water and agriculture sectors. Credit: Clima East.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using Data to Plan for Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major long-term changes in temperatures and rainfall will affect which crops and varieties grow best and where. Clima East experts worked with local counterparts to assess and adapt to the impacts of climate change on their country’s agriculture sectors. These climate-smart agriculture approaches adapt farming and markets to anticipated changes. If ministries can better understand and plan for the implementation of climate-smart policies, farmers and others associated with agriculture value chains—including consumers—will benefit from increased security in food and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clima East team knew that training specialists from partner countries was critical to promoting the long-term use of climate data in guiding policy. Clima East conducted regional events where climate specialists shared challenges and solutions in preparing their countries’ INDCs. These specialists also traveled to Germany and Poland to learn how these countries operate effective measuring and reporting mechanisms to track emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clima East supported specialists across the region to create complex emissions models and forecast impacts. For example, a 2014 workshop convened specialists from the six partner countries to train on an emissions modelling tool called Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning. Participants received national data starter packs to begin emission assessments, which some countries immediately put to use in developing their INDCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Clima-East-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Clima-East-3&quot; title=&quot;Strategy roundtable in Belarus to adapt agriculture to climate change, organized and supported by Belarus&amp;#39; Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection. Credit: Clima East.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Readily Replicable Programme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In five years, Clima East engaged 40 national government institutions and hosted more than 50 groups from civil society, academia, the private sector, and local government. These efforts collectively prepared six Eastern Partnership countries to develop and implement INDC emission-reduction plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This programme is readily replicable to other countries and regions. One hundred and sixty countries have ratified the Paris Agreement and another 35 are in the process of doing so. Clima East has shown that if their policy makers and climate specialists are brought together and equipped with the right tools and information, they, too, can work out a path toward green growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Messe Frankfurt’s Purchase of Source Africa Trade Show Exemplifies the Potential of Market Systems Development</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/messe-frankfurts-purchase-of-source-africa-trade-show-exemplifies-the-potential-of-market-systems-development</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 20:32:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/messe-frankfurts-purchase-of-source-africa-trade-show-exemplifies-the-potential-of-market-systems-development</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, DAI began implementing the value chain portion of Southern Africa Trade Hub (SATH), a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). SATH&amp;rsquo;s goal was to promote economic growth by fostering intraregional trade between select member states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During DAI’s initial work planning session, Mark Bennett, our textiles and garments specialist, was tasked with commercializing a business-to-business (B2B) trade event that previous USAID projects had been funding to the tune of about $150,000 per year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAI&amp;rsquo;s value chain team found that a good deal of business was being transacted at these B2B events, so why should USAID continue to foot the bill by annually engaging a consultant to pull the event together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was there a better way to ensure that trade in textiles and apparels was conducted on a commercially sustained basis, driven by the industry itself, rather than relying on donors like USAID to make it happen? DAI had previously commercialized donor-driven business matchmaking activities using private operators in Serbia and South Africa, so we knew it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Source-Africa-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Source-Africa-2&quot; title=&quot;The 2017 Source Africa trade show featured 151 exhibitors from 17 countries as well as five fashion shows. Credit: Source Africa&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took nine months, but DAI found a South African trade show company, LTE, and convinced its leaders that this event in their own country could be good business. It then took another six months to get all parties to agree to a cooperation framework going forward. Finally, Bennett and value chain component lead Don Greenberg, with support from SATH’s leadership, mobilized funding support to complement LTE’s investment, and together the parties established the Source Africa trade show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Source Africa, organized by LTE with some support from SATH, took place in 2013 in Cape Town, now the home of the show every year. In its first year, Source Africa attracted about 100 exhibitors; by 2016, LTE sold 183 booths to exhibitors from 14 countries, with about 1,500 people attending the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/Why%20Trade%20Shows%20May%202015.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Source-Africa-graphic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Source-Africa-graphic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each show, LTE incurs most of the risk—paying for the venue, engaging the stand builders, hiring staff, designing logos and web sites, and so on. While development-oriented donors have continued to support Source Africa—including the USAID-funded, DAI-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southern-africa-trade-and-investment-hub&quot;&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/east-africa-trade-and-investment-hub-tih&quot;&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt; trade and investment hubs—direct donor support of LTE has fallen to extremely low levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having built up a nice profitable business creating linkages across Southern and Eastern Africa’s textile and garment industry, LTE helped achieve the purpose of our various trade hubs, but without USAID in the middle—a clear case of a donor working its way out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Source-Africa-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Source-Africa-1&quot; title=&quot;Nearly 1,400 attendees from 16 countries came to the 2017 Source Africa trade show. Credit: Source Africa&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, the now highly successful Source Africa trade show was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fin24.com/Economy/messe-frankfurt-ready-to-take-sa-clothing-expos-to-next-level-20170908&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; to Germany&amp;rsquo;s Messe Frankfurt group, the third-largest trade show organizer in the world. Messe Frankfurt runs 134 trade fairs and exhibitions worldwide. Approximately 90,000 exhibitors and 3.5 million visitors attend its exhibitions each year. Under Messe’s umbrella, Source Africa will surely soar to even greater heights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakthroughs in trade require time, effort, and persistence—in any region of the world—but the result for developing nations is sustainable, inclusive economic growth that creates jobs and new wealth. The privatizing of Source Africa is one such breakthrough. It’s the kind of success—building local capacity to commercially fill market gaps by providing information and linking traders—that the global development community should be talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Q&amp;A: Unlocking Inclusive Economic Growth for Mozambicans by Building a Market for Digital Financial Inclusion</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/qa-assisting-mozambiques-rural-poor-to-build-stability-and-economic-opportunity-through-digital-financial-inclusion</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 16:12:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Mozambique’s economy is emerging—notably through the extractives sector—most Mozambicans remain very poor. Eighty percent still make a living from subsistence farming. One cause for their marginalization is that most have no connection to the wider economy or to basic financial services such as saving, borrowing, and electronic payments. This limits the ability of Mozambique’s 12 million rural poor to grow their livelihoods and perpetuates their isolation and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2014, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-financial-sector-deepening-fsdmoc&quot;&gt;Financial Sector Deepening Moçambique&lt;/a&gt; (FSDMoç) project is working to create access to financial services for at least 2.6 million households and 1,000 small and growing businesses. This access will enable Mozambique’s households and enterprises to use responsibly delivered finance to pay for seed and fertilizer, pay electronically for necessities such as medicine, and safely deposit their savings, among other benefits. Banking electronically and with mobile phones will reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with transacting in cash only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fsdmoc.com/&quot;&gt;FSDMoç&lt;/a&gt; is funded by the U.K. Department for International Development and Swedish International Development Agency. &lt;em&gt;Developments&lt;/em&gt; recently discussed FSDMoç with two members of its Maputo-based team—Investment Manager Benedito Murambire, below right, who develops private sector investments that support financial inclusion, and Market Development Manager Helder Buvana, below left, who focuses on investments in agribusiness and financial technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----FSD-Moz-2-pics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----FSD-Moz-2-pics&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How common is mobile technology in Mozambicans’ daily lives, and where do you see it going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedito:&lt;/em&gt; Mobile technology covers 82 percent of the population, but internet usage has not picked up at the same rate. Of those with coverage, 94 percent have used mobile phones for voice and 84 percent for text messaging. Thirty-one and 32 percent, respectively, have sent and received money, but only 23 percent have used social media, indicating low overall internet usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, the cost of 1 gigabyte of mobile broadband data in Mozambique is US$2.80, which compares favorably with, for example, neighboring Malawi at US$5.80. This lower cost provides opportunities for digital, including in financial services. But the use of cash still predominates, especially in rural districts. People are understandibly hesitant to try new things where their money is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Bhairav-FSD-Moz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Bhairav-FSD-Moz&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will drive growth in digital financial services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedito:&lt;/em&gt; Need and demand, which are plentiful. Remittances now drive services via Vodacom Mpesa, Zoona, or the mobile wallets of six different banks, but other needs are emerging. In addition to buying farm and household goods and services electronically, people would pay their insurance premiums, taxes, and fees that way, and government employees such as teachers and nurses would receive their salaries. Drought victims and others could receive e-vouchers for emergency and disaster relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helder:&lt;/em&gt; While remittances now drive mobile money, down the road electronic transactions will not simply be led by telecoms and banks—other payment platforms will adapt, such as retailers, petrol stations, and agro-dealers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----FSDMoz-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----FSDMoz-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do people with little or no money need to have access to digital financial services?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedito:&lt;/em&gt; Financial inclusion is about more than inclusion. Currently, the “unbanked” have to carry their cash, use their time, and travel to pay in person for everything—insurance, health care, water bills. Through its private sector partners, FSDMoç is facilitating better living by saving them the time and expense—and reducing the risk—posed by living cash only. People in developed countries, such as our donors in the United Kingdom and Sweden, are accustomed to saving time, seeking out convenience, and decreasing risk. FSDMoç is striving to deliver these same benefits for Mozambicans, and they do not need a lot of money to benefit. Eventually, all smallholders, households, shops, merchants, financial services providers, mobile network operators, and local government services will be connected and efficiencies will be gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helder:&lt;/em&gt; This includes scaling up through agricultural value chains, which FSDMoç is doing, so that all members are connected digitally. We are currently working in Mozambique’s cotton value chain trying to connect all of its actors digitally—from small-scale cotton producers to transporters to storage operators to exporters. This helps expedite payments back and forth while creating better data and records and opening up crossborder transactions and trade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----FSD-Moz-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----FSD-Moz-5&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What approach has FSDMoç taken to expand digital financial services?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helder:&lt;/em&gt; We work with multiple partners to influence Mozambique’s digital ecosystem. These include mobile network operators wishing to expand beyond cities, commercial banks developing safer loan products for rural borrowers—such as for solar home systems—and government agencies that need complementarity in their regulations, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important that we promote the innovation and new ideas required to connect these dots and make them work. In April, FSDMoç conducted the FinTech Challenge, where we received 22 applications from financial tech companies, with seven shortlisted to receive technical assistance from the FSDMoç team and £5,000 each. One of the winners is providing an accounting-based app for small and medium enterprises, for example, and another an app to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/breaking-a-wooden-box-under-a-mango-tree/?utm_source=daidotcom&quot;&gt;informal savings groups&lt;/a&gt; (known as xitiques). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;Winners in the FinTech Ideas Challenge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FSDMoç launched the FinTech Ideas Challenge to identify scalable solutions in Mozambique from entrepreneurs, developers, technology startups, financial service providers, students, researchers, and others. From the 22 proposals received, seven were selected for technical assistance and £5,000 each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX Information Technologies—xitique management app &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cartéira Movel (Mkesh)—xitique management app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heurística—credit management platform for individuals and small farmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apauma Construções Soc. Unipessoal—online payment gateaway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publiaki  Serviços, ei—group lending management app &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick e-pay—USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) payment gateway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PZC Services Lda—online invoicing system for SMEs&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the more promising trends and opportunities?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedito:&lt;/em&gt; Once there is a scalable digital ecosystem in Mozambique, we can expect electronic payment of premiums and claims for health or crop insurance, and the purchase of incremental construction materials for basic housing. This will materialize once there are ample digital transaction pools. In other words, once there is enough of a digital float in the system that enables cashing in and out of the system without delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also see ways in the short term to apply digital capabilities to benefit existing “bottom of the pyramid” local activities. This includes enabling groups to take out group loans with banks to buy seed and fertilizer, for example, and also to make group deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the magnitude of challenges faced by Mozambique’s poor, financial inclusion will only be sustainable if banks see the value of complementarity with financial tech or vice versa. If the banks play their cards right, they have access to a much larger client and partner base. If they act like a cartel, they will not gain access to a larger market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----FSDMoz-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----FSDMoz-2&quot; title=&quot;Laurinda Landa, age 25, is an M-Pesa Agent in Benfica Market in one of the townships of Maputo.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The success of mobile money in the region has generated a lot of news. What is the headline from Mozambique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helder:&lt;/em&gt; If we can increase the interoperability between users and suppliers at all levels, that will boost mobile money and payment channels, bring down transaction costs, and create a network effect. This is where the financial tech firms come in—to provide solutions and services that make mobile money and e-payments work better, and that make local financial institutions work better. For example, financial tech firms can develop software applications that help in logistics by facilitating payments between businesses and suppliers. Financial tech firms are the missing players in the system—as they emerge and grow, they will increasingly contribute to and help connect Mozambique’s fuller suite of digital services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benedito:&lt;/em&gt; We are working with the Banco de Moçambique (Central Bank) and the National Institute of Communications to enable and encourage financial tech firms to operate and help make the digital finance ecosystem more attractive and relevant for users. We plan to organise a supportive environment to incubate financial tech firms and create a “sandbox” approach where technology innovators are safe to test, learn, and collaborate with financial service operators.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Than Developing Apps: USAID Program Propels Cambodian Girls Into Global Technology Finals</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/its-not-all-about-the-app-narrowing-the-digital-gender-gap-usaid-program-propels-cambodia-girls-into-global-technology-contest-finals</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/its-not-all-about-the-app-narrowing-the-digital-gender-gap-usaid-program-propels-cambodia-girls-into-global-technology-contest-finals</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Women are far underrepresented in the tech world globally from bottom to top. The all-encompassing industry is looking into the mirror and seeing  men and boys dominating technology jobs, classrooms, and expert panels, a bias now widely noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/data-mine/articles/2016-10-20/study-computer-science-gender-gap-widens-despite-increase-in-jobs&quot;&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, only 18 percent of U.S. bachelor’s degrees in computer science were earned by women, who are projected to hold just 20 percent of professional computing jobs by 2025. Developing nations face similarly stark gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excluding women and girls exacerbates the general shortage of skilled applicants to fill jobs in programming, coding, and systems administration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608090/tim-cook-apple-isnt-falling-behind-its-just-not-ready-to-talk-about-the-future/&quot;&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook. “Technology,” Cook says, “has an enormous issue with gender diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Technovation-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Technovation-2&quot; title=&quot;Team members from the Cambodia Identity Project: Mariya Chan Phan, Sabda Serei Yos, Soucheng Dara Lorn, Socheata Chea, and Leza Sorn.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the girls from Cambodia: These enterprising young women recently won a trip to San Francisco where they faced 11 other teams of young techies as finalists in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://technovationchallenge.org/world-pitch/&quot;&gt;Technovation World Pitch Summit in August&lt;/a&gt;. The global competition attracted more than 1,100 teams of girls ages 10 to 18, each competing to develop the best app to solve social problems. As global finalists, the girls received $5,000 from Technovation to further develop their idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodian entrants, 23 teams in all, were supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; (DI) project, implemented by DAI, with co-funding from Cambodian private sector partners. The girls’ winning idea: an app called the Cambodia Identity Product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our mobile app allows local people to promote their products,” said team leader Lorn Dara Soucheng. “There are so many poor people here. Many kids who do not have jobs migrate to neighboring countries like Thailand to work. This is the reason that led us to create this app—to help Cambodians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team thinks its app will promote the purchase of various local products, from farm produce to artisanal creations such as traditional silk scarves and jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;App Contest: Gateway to Tech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cambodia, many parents steer girls toward careers in more established fields such as administration and finance, versus computer science or other tech-focused fields. To enter the Technovation competition, girls and their parents had to commit to the 12-week, open-source curriculum, which was developed by Iridescent, a U.S.-based education nonprofit that produces Technovation and supported the finalists’ travel and accommodation in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put out calls to girls to join the introductory session, DI joined with the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and used local and social media. In January, the girls went to work designing their projects, supported by more than 30 volunteer mentors recruited by DI from the business community and tech sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the team behind Cambodia Identity Product, this meant convening at the Royal University of Phnom Penh every Sunday with their mentor, Putthira, an iOS developer for a local software company who accompanied them to San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together they surveyed citizens to define the problem, used MIT AppInventor to build and refine the app, conducted market analysis, designed a business plan, and prepared a sales pitch. Private sector sponsors Digital Mobile Innovations, Smart, and Ezecom covered operational funds, hoping to develop digital literacy and potentially a pipeline of smart, connected young women with practical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I learned a lot [about] coding, business, initiating business ideas to help better Cambodia society,” Soucheng said. “Plus, I learned how to share responsibilities in such a big project and about team collaboration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nP7En-NRJo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bigger and Better Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing the app has proven more than a practical learning tool. The Technovation program strives to induct girls into technology and build the technical and professional skills needed to feed emerging economies for future generations. The girls who created Cambodia Identity Product are only 11 and 12 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This practical program is helping bridge the digital access divide in Cambodia. Learning one programming language prepares the girls to learn and write other codes in the future—including ones not yet invented—while the contest compelled them to think in terms of business, profit, and sustainability. Equipped with these skills, the girls can keep learning, join online communities, and pursue their technology dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan Wojnicki, the longtime Google executive and now CEO of YouTube, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-wojcicki/tech-industry-gender-gap_b_9089472.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; recently in an address to the Anita Borg Institute: “Unless we make computer science a priority, we risk making gender, class, and racial disparities worse as jobs and opportunities flow to those who have a computer science background.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past participants of Technovation in Cambodia have told the DI team that they enrolled in software engineering majors at universities in Phnom Penh after being inspired by the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodia DI staff, the girls’ school—the Liger Learning Center—and our volunteer mentors are all proud of the girls’ remarkable achievement. Most important, though, is that with the girls now home from San Francisco, we look forward to helping them move their app idea to the next level, as well as encouraging them to mentor Technovation Cambodia’s next generation of all-girl problem solvers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Q&amp;A: Barry Finette on the Hopes and Challenges for THINKMD’s Life-Saving mHealth Platform</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/qa-barry-finette-on-the-hopes-and-challenges-for-thinkmds-life-saving-mhealth-platform</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2017 17:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/qa-barry-finette-on-the-hopes-and-challenges-for-thinkmds-life-saving-mhealth-platform</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DAI and THINKMD connected in 2016 through DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/innovation-action-challenge-winners-begin-implement-their-solutions-field&quot;&gt;Innovation into Action Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Our strategic partnership will leverage DAI’s international development network to bring THINKMD’s digital health products to new markets, while THINKMD’s technology will enhance DAI’s global health toolkit. As part of this partnership, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-invests-in-thinkmds-clinical-assessment-technology&quot;&gt;DAI led THINKMD’s latest financing round&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2014, THINKMD soon introduced its first product, MEDSINC—a mobile health platform that enables non-healthcare professionals in marginalized locales lacking doctors, nurses, and clinics—to perform clinical assessment, triage, early treatment, and follow-up, especially on infants and young children. THINKMD’s second product, DATASINC, aggregates and analyzes public health and epidemiology data for a variety of uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkmd.org/&quot;&gt;THINKMD&lt;/a&gt; was co-founded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkmd.org/barry-finette/&quot;&gt;Barry Finette&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics, microbiology, and molecular genetics at the University of Vermont College of Medicine and Vermont Children’s Hospital. Finette’s expertise is in clinical and transitional research, and he is a clinical attending physician in general, emergency, critical, and acute care medicine. He has participated in numerous medical research projects and relief missions in countries worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developments&lt;/em&gt; recently asked Finette, pictured below in the Philippines, about the prospects for MEDSINC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Barry-pic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Barry-pic&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sparked the idea for the MEDSINC platform?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly 30 years, I have had the privilege to serve as a pediatrician for families around the world. The most difficult experience has been seeing children dying from treatable diseases such as pneumonia, dehydration secondary to diarrhea, and infections. The main reason for these preventable deaths is the vast shortage of healthcare professionals and limited healthcare delivery infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these locales, the best solution is to devise a way to transfer medical knowledge and basic but important skills to non-healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My idea was to merge evidenced-based medicine for the clinical assessment, triage, and treatment of children with the power of mobile technology—then put it into the hands of minimally skilled frontline healthcare workers, thereby expanding healthcare capacity directly in the communities where the humanitarian need was greatest.&amp;quot;—Barry Finette&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sicknesses or medical situations are most common in these locales that can be addressed remotely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many low- and middle-income countries, perinatal and under-5 mortality is very high. MEDSINC evaluates these children using the same parameters that I would as a pediatrician—severity of respiratory distress, dehydration, malnutrition, and risk of infection. It also screens for common illnesses based on local epidemiology and prevalence through configuring the platform—these illnesses typically include malaria, meningitis, anemia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, ear infections, measles, and dysentery. Considering just these illnesses, expanded access to mobile-enabled triage and treatment recommendations could prevent, based on our current modeling, 300 child deaths per 1,000 MEDSINC users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to people suffering and perhaps dying unnecessarily, what are the consequences of untreated ailments to local communities?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences are significant. High infant and childhood mortality damages every aspect of families’ lives. In communities, prevalent childhood illness devastates both emotionally &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; economically. Family members’ ability to work is undermined when they must care for a child or travel hours or days to try to see a doctor. These families are generally larger than those in countries with lower childhood mortality, and the ability to earn income is imperative. Direct and indirect costs to communities are compounded at regional and country levels. Through the implementation of MEDSINC, our models suggest that $19.4 million in productivity gains could be seen per 1,000 MEDSINC users by decreasing morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/215518121&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There appears to be a great need for better local healthcare in many corners of the globe, but is there a calculated market demand for MEDSINC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. The social impact opportunity is immense, but the market opportunity is just as great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current and projected technology offerings are configurable to many contexts to solve problems for customers in many sectors—including point-of-care assessment and treatment, humanitarian and emergency response and assistance, health system capacity building, and disease and outbreak surveillance. MEDSINC can fill needs that enable healthcare system efficiency and sustainability without sacrificing quality. We have tested MEDSINC with internationally recognized global health leaders on four continents and developed strategic and commercial partnerships with leading global healthcare groups and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the most important requirements MEDSINC had to meet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We studied, observed, and listened first to the beneficiaries—to understand their needs and design a scalable, efficient, mobile platform solution. The main design principle was simplicity over complexity in filtering out the noise and focusing on what mattered. The platform had to have a simple and intuitive user interface and it had to function on/offline, on any web-enabled device. Furthermore, we wanted the platform to act as a continuous learning and training tool for the user. Finally, the tool needed to connect the user to the broader health system as a knowledge acquisition network—facilitating data acquisition and storage, capturing real-time and geo-located health data, and enabling communication between users and healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Finette-QA-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Finette-QA-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where has MEDSINC been used so far, and how has that gone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have performed validation and usability-accessibility testing in four continents and across a range of settings, from hospitals in the United States to rural communities in Burkina Faso and urban slums in Bangladesh. Our testings have shown that with minimal training, clinical assessments performed by frontline health workers using MEDSINC correlate from 80 percent to greater than 95 percent compared with physicians’ assessments. In July, MEDSINC was implemented with our initial adopter, Save the Children International in Dhaka, Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have you learned from this experience that you have fed back into the product?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve always been ready to question the way things are and we have been willing to push boundaries and disrupt where appropriate. We see every validation testing, implementation, etc., as an opportunity to learn and improve upon the platform. We rigorously collect and assess user feedback—continuously iterating and ensuring a product-market fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is DATASINC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DATASINC is our data repository and analytics tool based on the data that MEDSINC generates through patient interactions. DATASINC translates aggregated MEDSINC data into informative dashboards and reports. This data and analysis offer actionable insights that organizations, governments, or companies can use to make strategic decisions regarding the health of their populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Finette-QA-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Finette-QA-2&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will be the effect of rolling out MEDSINC and DATASINC in resource-poor countries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knowledge and data we accumulate via DATASINC leads to new ideas and solutions. Developing a valuable data repository elevates healthcare knowledge, which expands capacity and delivery. Digital health platforms such as MEDSINC connect the existing health workforce in these countries with established, evidence-based medicine. By empowering these local health workers to deliver basic health services, we build up a country’s existing health infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;WHO-UNICEF estimates that 3 million children aged 5 and under die each year from illnesses that could have been prevented with appropriate clinical assessments and early therapeutic intervention. If left unresolved, the lack of basic healthcare in resource-poor countries alone will lead to 50 million preventable childhood deaths by 2030.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the business model for THINKMD and MEDSINC?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, THINKMD is a healthcare innovation company. We are initially focused on providing software and data analytics solutions to a wide range of users. The first products we offer are MEDSINC and DATASINC. We recently launched our first &lt;em&gt;commercial&lt;/em&gt; implementation of these platforms with Save the Children in Bangladesh. We have a pipeline of partners interested in adopting these products, and as we move our technology out further we’ll grow both MEDSINC and DATASINC revenues. Through growth in users, we’ll generate a profit margin that enables the venture to sustain itself and support internal operations, while continuing to innovate and deliver on our product roadmap of innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Finette-QA-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Finette-QA-4&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you finding to be the main hurdles to implementing MEDSINC in developing and conflict-affected countries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main hurdle we face is acceptance of our new technology, coupled with a slow adoption cycle among government and nongovernmental organizations. The process of confirming interest and getting adoption and contracts is traditionally quite slow for those types of entities and is something we must constantly navigate as a small and young company. That said, our persistence is starting to pay off and we are beginning to see partners adopt our products based on their acute need for our solutions, and the fact that we’ve done the appropriate testing and validation to prove that our products work and are user friendly. Our partnerships with groups like Save the Children, UNICEF, and DAI are each force multipliers in our pursuit of product adoption and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if anything has come so far from your partnership with DAI? Insights? New ideas for application?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between our teams has already yielded a lot of critical opportunities. Obviously, THINKMD neatly fits within DAI’s Global Health program, especially with DAI’s expertise and focus on tech-enabled healthcare data and analytics. We are engaged on a pipeline of potential projects and look forward to being on the ground implementing with DAI’s health-focused projects soon. In addition to health, we’ve been thrilled to see interest from other DAI programs, in arenas such as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), governance, and countering violent extremism. Notwithstanding the healthcare focus of our software, the basic clinical and data-gathering solution we provide can add significant direct value to a number of different types of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Possibilities: The Role of Governance in Countering Violent Extremism in Iraq</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/new-possibilities-the-role-of-governance-in-countering-violent-extremism-in-iraq</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 17:09:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Bryan Schuetz</author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/new-possibilities-the-role-of-governance-in-countering-violent-extremism-in-iraq</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can improving governance contribute to the fight against violent extremism? While the absence of good governance is often cited as a driver of violent extremism, it is less clear how the &lt;em&gt;presence&lt;/em&gt; of good governance can contribute to its reduction. In the case of Iraq, violence has not only been endemic for much of its modern history, but violence itself was the basis of governance and often glorified as a legitimate lever of change. This paper explores how improving governance can both inhibit radicalization and promote de-radicalization, drawing in part on examples taken from U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/saladdin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;saladdin&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Obama Administration, the U.S. Government policy on countering violent extremism (CVE) was articulated by the Department of State and USAID in two papers appearing in 2011 and 2016, as well as in a White House conference on the subject in 2015. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that these documents reflect one aspect of the U.S. Government response, since the overwhelming majority of resources devoted to CVE have supported military or policing operations against violent extremist organizations. Daniel Aldrich has estimated that between FY 2001 and 2012, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/gpridocs/8/&quot;&gt;only 5 percent of the total&lt;/a&gt; amount spent on the “War on Terror” went to diplomatic and development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such “hard power” operations are no doubt critical, by definition they take place after radicalization has taken place. They address an existing problem rather than prevent its emergence. Within the U.S. Government, there is an ongoing debate as to whether CVE efforts should comprise mainly military operations or whether we need a greater emphasis on non-kinetic and non-lethal approaches. My supposition is that the latter approach not only mitigates violent extremism—it may also assist military operations when these are deemed necessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Iraq, the effort to improve governance in general has been complicated by weak existing government structures. Since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, Iraqi governments have had to contend with intense sectarian mistrust, which has led to near civil war-like conditions compounded by self-imposed problems of corruption and lack of transparency. Absent general security—real or perceived—Iraqis have taken shelter within their narrower ethnic or sectarian identities, urged on by unscrupulous politicians, religious leaders, and neighboring countries enacting their own agendas. Recent polling and events indicate that the current Iraqi government continues to be seen as a largely Shia institution that enjoys limited legitimacy among the country’s Sunnis. While extremism is not purely a Sunni phenomenon, their grievances have been exploited by transnational Sunni extremist groups including al Qaeda and, currently, ISIS.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various solutions have been proposed to address Iraq’s deficit of good governance. Efforts to strengthen local governance by increasing accountability and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/the-role-of-decentralization-in-combatting-extremist-influence-in-iraq&quot;&gt;decentralizing power&lt;/a&gt; to the provinces have taken on particular importance. While these efforts are valuable in their own right, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/iraq/governance&quot;&gt;they do not directly take on the issue of violent extremism&lt;/a&gt;. They do, however, attempt to improve some of the conditions widely held to foster such extremism. Given that much of the recent literature on CVE emphasizes the importance of a local approach, the prospect of using planned programming to improve local governance to strengthen CVE efforts appears promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/quadissya.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;quadissya&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is CVE?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the vast resources spent to address violent extremism, it has no universally agreed definition. Writing for the Foreign Policy Research Institute, Will McCants and Clinton Watts found “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fpri.org/article/2012/12/u-s-strategy-for-countering-violent-extremism-an-assessment/&quot;&gt;there is not a shared view of what CVE is or what it should do&lt;/a&gt;” when referring to U.S. Government policy initiatives. In their 2016 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAE503.pdf&quot;&gt;Joint Strategy on CVE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, USAID and State defined CVE as “proactive actions to counter efforts by violent extremists to radicalize, recruit, and mobilize followers to violence and to address specific factors that facilitate violent extremist recruitment and radicalization to violence.” This definition implies that CVE takes place before radicalization by emphasizing the pre-emptive nature of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, efforts to suppress radicalization before it occurs must form a central piece of the policy response. Others have stressed that in order for CVE to be effective, it must also provide a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/03/21/a-how-to-on-countering-violent-extremism/&quot;&gt;path back from radicalization&lt;/a&gt;—a redemption that may occur after incarceration or other legal sanctions but that also prevents a return to radicalization. Some observers have sought to distinguish between sympathizers of radical extremist groups and full-blown supporters (see McCants and Watts), while others note the difficulties in doing so, pointing out that members of violent extremist organizations often separate themselves from the community in which most sympathizers are found, although they communicate with them, often via social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty in defining CVE stems from difficulties in describing it. Understood from a larger social, cultural, and political context, violent extremism can be seen as the product of numerous factors, such as marginalization or as a religiously justified response to political circumstances. But as our focus moves down to the community and even to the individual level, other factors emerge that can only be understood in a local context. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/national-strategic-framework-countering-violent-extremism-jordan&quot;&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that youth in Kenya were motivated to join al-Shabab largely because of the lack of educational opportunities, while young men in Saudi Arabia presented religious justifications for their radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consensus holds that there is no “silver bullet” to tackle the multiplicity of causes leading to radicalization, just as there is no single path leading there. But considerable attention has been given to the various “push” and “pull” factors driving individuals toward violent extremism. In USAID and State’s &lt;em&gt;Joint Strategy&lt;/em&gt;, cited above, push factors “create the opportunities for violent extremists to gain traction,” while pull factors include those tactics used by extremist organizations to attract recruits. Push factors include systematic human rights violations, marginalization, ungoverned or poorly governed areas, and endemic corruption; pull factors include the perversion of religious doctrine or an appeal to an individual’s sense of self-worth or desire for advancement. Extremist organizations may also goad an individual to avenge perceived injustices. Implicit in all these factors is the idea that traditional political means are incapable of correcting the existing, intolerable situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Aldrich sees this last concept as an opening for the use of “soft power” in CVE: “recognizing the multiple factors which can radicalize individuals and either push or pull them to join violent extremist organizations, the soft approach to counter-terrorism seeks to decrease the likelihood of recruitment and dry up the labor pool for potential terrorists.” For Aldrich, soft power may “give potential recruits a viable alternative for which to live, not die,” a useful corollary to U.S. Admiral and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen’s recognition that “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/09/10/mullen-cannot-kill-our-way-to-victory-in-afghanistan.html&quot;&gt;We cannot kill our way to victory&lt;/a&gt;.” In addition, kinetic operations can cause collateral damage that undermines CVE efforts by reinforcing the narrative of grievances against the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Lister-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Lister-2&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Should Be Expected from a CVE Program in Iraq?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the absence of good governance is one of the push factors driving extremist recruitment, and if—as the &lt;em&gt;Joint Strategy&lt;/em&gt; argues—local solutions are critical in addressing drivers of radicalization, then the role of local government in facilitating such solutions is clear and compelling. In the case of Iraq, however, local government is hampered by a low degree of trust, which stems in turn from those governments’ chronic inability to deliver basic services. The many causes of these failures include a lack of staff capacity but also structural problems such as an incomplete program of decentralization, which has led to confusion about roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any governance program broadly applicable to the problem of violent extremism in Iraq would at minimum seek to incorporate the following themes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally speaking, we need a more accurate rendering of the problems confronted by Iraqi communities. At present, we have mostly anecdotal evidence of the prevalence of specific drivers. For example, regarding the Sunni community, there are an estimated 25,000 fighters currently with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. While some of these are foreigners and others have been forcibly conscripted, we lack reliable information about where most of the fighters come from and the specific factors behind their radicalization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legitimacy&lt;/strong&gt;. Only through government can the problems of political and social marginalization be addressed successfully in the long term. Additionally, good government can serve as a coordinating body for various strands of a locally implemented CVE policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that much of Iraq’s violent extremism is the result of sectarian divisions, interventions need to pay specific attention to the role of religion and seek to recover a tolerant religious narrative to undercut that used by extremist organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Society&lt;/strong&gt;. Civic organizations can play a vital role in addressing those gaps that local governments are unable to fill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration&lt;/strong&gt;. Programs should emphasize both counter-radicalization and de-radicalization, the precise blend depending on local conditions. Where there are significant numbers of returnees from violent organizations, for example, in areas recently recaptured from ISIS, the de-radicalization components will be critical. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youth&lt;/strong&gt;. CVE depends largely on how well we deal with the problems of youth in situations where extreme violence is the norm rather than the exception. The role of women is of equal importance given the degree to which mothers and other female authority figures influence young people toward or away from violent extremism (as in the case of the “Hakamat” singers in Sudan, discussed below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Lister-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Lister-3&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the writing on CVE is theoretical in nature or offers possible interventions based on generic assumptions extrapolated to what is known of local conditions. In the following section, I attempt to shed some light on the possible approaches in Iraq by reference to approaches proven successful or relevant in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Communications&lt;/strong&gt;. USAID’s Kenya Niwajibu Wetu project (known as NIWETU, or “It’s our responsibility” in Kiswaheli), implemented by DAI, shows the importance of strategic communications. A stakeholder engagement forum of 64 participants found that existing counter-terrorism efforts were perceived as coercive, with inadequate attention paid to the rights of those targeted. The forum revealed there was only a limited understanding of what CVE efforts were supposed to accomplish, thanks in part to inadequate attention paid to these efforts by local media. Participants complained that massive security sweeps were exacerbating radicalization rather than diminishing it. And against this backdrop of escalating drivers there was no salient, credible counter-narrative to mitigate extremist messaging. Accordingly, the project decided to engage the Supreme Council of Kenyan Muslims to work with vulnerable youth groups to undercut radicalizing religious narratives, and it took immediate steps to engage the local community such as organizing football tournaments for young men. The bottom line: proactive and responsive strategic communications capacity is critical to the CVE enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due Diligence and Aftercare&lt;/strong&gt;. In Singapore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/national-strategic-framework-countering-violent-extremism-jordan&quot;&gt;as Ghimar Deeb and colleagues report&lt;/a&gt;, security officials designed a complex set of criteria to determine whether a person detained for participating in a violent extremist organization could be released. The assessment included input from religious counselors, prison officials, psychologists, and case workers. In addition, the Aftercare Services Group provides counseling and practical support to families of detainees, including skills training and other forms of post-release help. Family members in general participate in rehabilitation programs where such participation is appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate Islam&lt;/strong&gt;. While serving as the Department of State’s Senior Civilian Representative with the 173rd Airborne in Logar and Wardak Provinces, Afghanistan, I worked with Brigade leadership to host influential members of the Logar religious community in Jordan (taking advantage of the presence of a Jordanian battalion posted to our base). Not all the travelers to Jordan were religious figures; some won a place because they were believed to be influential in the broader community. The attendees came back impressed deeply by the peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims in Jordan and by seeing a devout Muslim country practicing a more moderate form of their religion. The goal of the visit was to undercut the Taliban message that coexistence between Islam and other religions could only be bought at the price of a compromised faith. While most programs operating in Iraq would not have the resources to fly people abroad, the critical point of disputing a radicalizing religious narrative remains valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Livelihoods—for Men and Women&lt;/strong&gt;. The Toward Enduring Peace in Sudan (TEPS) program was the sole USAID-funded project in Sudan intended to serve development rather than humanitarian aims. The project worked primarily in conflict zones and sought to mitigate sources of conflict where these existed, but tried as well to help prevent a return to the fighting. As such, TEPS—while not explicitly a CVE program—served many of the same purposes of counter-radicalization and de-radicalization. Noteworthy is TEPS’ work in vocational training and alternative livelihoods for young men and for some of the female-headed households in these areas (of which there were many, due to extended periods of war). Virtually all the young men found employment following their training and after being provided a basic tool kit to help get them started. Similarly, mothers who took alternative livelihoods training reported that their children did not resort to the militias to support their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Programming&lt;/strong&gt;. A second component of TEPS was peace messaging. Street theater and cultural festivals demonstrated the possibility of peaceful coexistence in areas long ravaged by war. Specifically, the program worked with the “Hakamat” singers, women who traditionally sang songs urging their husbands and sons to fight but in this case took a more conciliatory stance. Of note: Because of sanctions against the Sudanese government, the program could not work directly with national authorities and had to seek indirect approval from local government entities, with implementation though civil society organizations. Such organizations could also be powerful instruments of change in Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Lister-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Lister-1&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most observers believe that the Iraqi Government and its Western allies will prevail militarily against ISIS. But the military campaign will not, by itself, end the cycles of violence that plague Iraqi society. Peace and stability can only be achieved through the creation of government structures seen as legitimate by their constituents. While a political “grand bargain” remains elusive, efforts to make local governments more effective could be an important step in tamping down the violence as local governments tend to be present in areas which are more homogeneous demographically and therefore face fewer of the sectarian challenges that the national government confronts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to improve local governance could contribute to an overall CVE strategy in the country. In particular, harnessing local civil society organizations—inherently more flexible than government entities—could erect a formidable barrier to the spread of violent extremist organizations. Civil society organizations could take on some of the functions described above, such as bringing religious figures, lay leaders, and government officials together around a more tolerant vision of Islam. And such organizations could deal with the highly localized and in some cases individual factors leading to radicalization, as well as assisting with returnees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this framework, local security forces will still have an important role to play. In some cases, the de-radicalization efforts will have to take place either during or following the extremist’s incarceration. Counter-radicalization can lead to a more effective countering of recruitment techniques used by violent extremist organizations as well as a deeper understanding of the drivers of radicalization in the first place. But as seen in the case of Kenya, a CVE strategy focused exclusively on security can stigmatize an already vulnerable population and increase the likelihood of radicalization rather than reduce it. The purely civilian component of CVE is essential to ensure appropriate messaging and open communications between vulnerable populations and the government.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cold Storage Expansion Drives Market Development in Uzbekistan</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/the-proliferation-of-cold-storage-in-uzbekistan</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/the-proliferation-of-cold-storage-in-uzbekistan</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were amazed to see a packed audience in 2010 when our team from the Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA) traveled to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Our Uzbek trainees came from many backgrounds—teachers, builders, businessmen—eager to learn about this vital link in the agricultural value chain. Most did not have experience in the cold chain, let alone a refrigeration facility to manage, yet they soon formed the foundation for the country’s remarkable cold chain development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a public policy directive issued in 2011 by the Government of Uzbekistan and supported by international financial institutions, the government established a preferential lending regime for the cold storage sector. Uzbekistan has since increased its refrigerated warehousing from 258,000 cubic meters in 2010 to more than 3.5 million cubic meters with technical assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) AgLinks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-aglinks-plus&quot;&gt;AgLinks Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-usaid-agricultural-value-chain-activity-uzbekistan-uzbekistan-avc&quot;&gt;Agricultural Value Chains&lt;/a&gt; (AVC) programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers have enjoyed greater sales growth in high-value vegetables and fruits—such as grapes, cherries, and apricots—as a result of the crops’ longer lifespans. This boom in cold-storage infrastructure has enhanced Uzbekistan’s market capabilities, improving the abilities of farmers, transporters, grocers, and exporters to increase sales. In 2016 alone, for example, horticultural exports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurofresh-distribution.com/news/uzbekistan-increases-its-horticultural-exports&quot;&gt;jumped by 38 percent&lt;/a&gt;, to more than 800,000 tons of fruit and vegetables. These results have also enabled households in Uzbekistan to consume fruits and vegetables more readily and over a longer period of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Uzbek-cold-chain-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Uzbek-cold-chain-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enthusiasm for New Ways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of the Soviet Union 25 years ago challenged Uzbekistan’s agricultural community to take on significant agricultural reform and job redistribution. Large farm collectives were broken up and redistributed to private farm enterprises, with infrastructure and agricultural practices needing rehabilitation and retooling to meet the needs of more market-oriented private farms and businesses.
In 2007, DAI launched the USAID AgLinks Uzbekistan program to consolidate the hard-earned gains made under earlier development assistance projects. In addition to building the capacity of private farmers, agroprocessors, and public sector entities, DAI partnered with the GCCA to help new entrants expand Uzbekistan’s cold chain by means of technical assistance designed to complement financial incentives—thereby supporting ongoing agricultural gains and facilitating economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;A “cold chain” manages the temperature of perishable products to maintain quality and safety from slaughter or harvest through distribution to the final consumer, essentially from farm to fork. The cold chain is composed of links, each essential to the integrity of food quality and safety. These links include postharvest activities, processing, transportation, storage and consolidation, retail, and, finally, a consumer’s refrigerator. An effective cold chain enables farmers to diversify production to include high-value perishable crops that increase earnings and benefit supporting industries such as transportation and export. High-value fruits and vegetables fetch higher prices than traditional crops such as cotton and potatoes.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_copy_app_choice-9&quot; title=&quot;Devs -- Uzbekistan Cold Store&quot; src=&quot;//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed.js?9uz&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited shelf life hinders profitability. For example, using traditional means, grapes could only be kept a few months after harvest. Even if the grapes ended up in refrigerated cases at supermarkets, the product had usually been kept uncooled for several days before making it to that point. Following training provided by the AVC project, grapes are now being cooled within 8-12 hours and shelf life has been extended to up to 180 days through the combination of best cold storage practices and the introduction of sulphur dioxide pads to inhibit mold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/210491523&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Market-Driven Agricultural Expansion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of cold-storage facilities resulted from a combination of forces. First, market demand for fresh fruits required increased cold storage. Second, the Government of Uzbekistan, in collaboration with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and others, has emphasized lending to the horticultural industry through preferential loan programs orchestrated with local banks. Third, the technical assistance provided by GCCA through AVC and AgLinks assured these cold-storage facilities are managed using best technical practices. Finally, a rapid return on investment is enabling investors to repay their cold-storage loans and further expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These facilities range in capacity from 20 to 20,000 metric tons. Some of the smaller structures use air conditioners that have been adapted using CoolBot technology, while the larger facilities use commercial-scale refrigeration equipment. GCCA played a major role through the AgLinks Plus project in providing a technical training program for Uzbek refrigeration technicians in direct response to industry demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing number of facilities has also complemented the growing table grape, cherry, and apricot markets. These products now move much more easily into export markets in the region and beyond, growing capabilities and profits for farmers, logistics providers, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uzbekistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.int/uzbekistan/news/uzbek-agriculture-progress-and-achievements#&quot;&gt;prioritized agricultural growth&lt;/a&gt; as a means to help address social issues such as employment, wellbeing, and further urban and rural development, and the country itself deserves the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the credit for its cold storage transformation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Government of Uzbekistan authorized USAID’s horticultural support program and sought  affordable credit options for cold chain developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Uzbek business community, specifically early-adopting producers and exporters, grasped the entrepreneurial opportunity to make the necessary investments in their own business capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collectively, the government and the private sector developed the linkages needed to access international markets willing and able to pay for high-value fruits and vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Uzbek-cold-chain-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Uzbek-cold-chain-3&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Becoming a Cold-Chain World Leader&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more than 2,000 cold storage facilities accounting for nearly 4 million cubic meters of capacity, Uzbekistan now ranks among the Global Top 20 in the Global Cold Chain Alliance’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gcca.org/resources/publications/white-papers-reports/global-cold-storage-capacity/&quot;&gt;Global Cold Chain Capacity Report&lt;/a&gt; for 2016, among the likes of China, Brazil, and Mexico. Yet, Uzbekistan still has work to do: it is estimated that total capacity needs to be up to 10 times the present amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AVC and GCCA will continue to promote the development of refrigerated transportation, increased food safety, and the use of larger facilities. It is likely the Uzbek cold chain will undergo  consolidation, reducing the number of facilities but increasing the total capacity, thus driving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global Cold Chain Alliance is proud to have partnered in this growth with DAI, USAID, and the people and Government of Uzbekistan in building the foundation for a world class cold chain. As its agricultural value chains continue to develop, Uzbekistan will increasingly become a leader in production, jobs creation, and economic growth in the Central Asian region.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Development Assistance to Catalyze Sound Investments in Emerging and Developing Markets</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-development-assistance-to-catalyze-sound-investments-in-emerging-and-developing-markets</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author> </author>
      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/using-development-assistance-to-catalyze-sound-investments-in-emerging-and-developing-markets</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Investment opportunities in manufacturing, agriculture, and health are as abundant globally as the capital to fund them, but investors in these and other sectors are rightly cautious about entering new countries and taking risks on small and growing businesses and productive infrastructure. Fortunately, there are many examples in these teeming markets of how capital supported by local development expertise and entrepreneurial energy has generated both financial returns and development results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other donors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-the-invest-project&quot;&gt;pursuing&lt;/a&gt; “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Blended_Finance_A_Primer_Development_Finance_Philanthropic_Funders_report_2015.pdf&quot;&gt;blended finance&lt;/a&gt;” as an approach to attract productive capital into developing countries. Blending private capital with donor-funded local expertise and risk-mitigation instruments can leverage donor resources, yield competitive returns for investors, and increase stability and prosperity for citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it already has. DAI is helping to mobilize capital that generates profit and alleviates poverty by convening the right partners, developing solid business plans, structuring investment deals, addressing policy constraints, and realistically projecting and delivering positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Blended-pic-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Blended-pic-2&quot; title=&quot;American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) President Rick Helfenbein, left, and DAI&amp;#39;s Juan Estrada of the East Africa Trade and Investment Hub. The AAFA, which represents more than 1,000 brands generating $361 billion in annual U.S. retail sales, recently signed a partnership agreement with the Hub to address constraints to competitiveness and expansion of the industry in East Africa.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Facilitating Trade and Investment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across East Africa, USAID and DAI have engaged transaction advisors CrossBoundary and used pay-for-results contracts to close investment deals. This program under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/east-africa-trade-and-investment-hub-tih&quot;&gt;East Africa Trade and Investment Hub&lt;/a&gt; (EATIH) has closed $51.1 million of investment transactions in two years for eight firms in the mobile technology, financial services, logistics, dairy, and poultry sectors. An additional $75 million in transactions is pending closure, with $133 million more in the pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this pay-for-results approach has shortened the deal-closure timeline from 18 to 24 months to six to 10 months, thereby reducing transaction costs and leading to follow-on deals from other investors. DAI’s local team helps to nurture the pipeline from beginning to end: mapping capital, targeting geographies and sectors, validating opportunities, conducting due diligence, modeling financials, raising funds, structuring transactions, ensuring neutral intermediation, and planning the post-investment phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EATIH issued a second bid for investment transaction services focused on underserved, smaller, export-oriented businesses—specifically, those requiring some assistance to help them become investment ready and seeking up to $1 million in financing. Open Capital Advisors, which has offices in Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia, was contracted and has begun work on a pay-for-results basis. DAI is adapting this results-based model on USAID’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southern-africa-trade-hub-sath&quot;&gt;Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hub&lt;/a&gt; (SATIH) and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Blended-pic-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Blended-pic-7&quot; title=&quot;The Africa Sourcing and Fashion Week trade expo in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, promoted East African countries as sourcing and investment destinations for international buyers of apparel, textile, leather, and home decor.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Africa offers an abundance of small and growing businesses and uninvested capital. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eatradehub.org/&quot;&gt;To support investment&lt;/a&gt;, EATIH developed a deal pipeline for its roster of regional private equity and impact investors. The team also supported companies to become investor ready, while adhering to USAID requirements that investees have regional presence, create jobs, and encourage gender parity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one multimillion-dollar investment by a private U.S. firm enabled MB PLC (Family Milk) of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to boost production from 20,000 liters per day to 60,000. Another private equity firm invested in a regional logistics company, enabling it to convert 100 trucks to cold storage, which is critical for growing agricultural value chains. These trucks are now transporting horticultural produce across borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2016, the Pretoria-based SATIH is also accommodating different types of investors, including pension funds. The pension fund model requires longer-term, equitable returns, with transactions in the $25 million to $500 million range. Investments of this profile tend to be large infrastructure projects such as toll roads or fiber optics, which would help with regional trade. SATIH also works to improve the enabling environment by working to align national investment policies with the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and is conducting an investor survey on the investment climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID’s support for constructive deal-making is not limited to Africa. Its Jordan Competitiveness Program (JCP) selected 15 companies from three target sectors—ICT, clean technology, and health care—to participate in a Growth Readiness Program. In collaboration with the American University of Beirut and Inventis Consulting Group, JCP designed and delivered technical assistance to each firm, facilitated pitches to investors, and ultimately helped six of the firms raise $17.6 million. American University is now exploring how to institutionalize the program to assist more of Jordan’s small and growing businesses to access capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobilizing Capital in Somaliland&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Somaliland, USAID and DAI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/somalia-partnership-economic-growth&quot;&gt;conducted the territory’s first business-plan competition&lt;/a&gt;. Local entrepreneurs wowed judges with their entries, the winners earning more than $1 million in matching grants to co-fund their growth in promising sectors such as agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and renewable energy. The businesses leveraged $12 million in local, diaspora, and foreign investor capital—leading, for example, to the development of the region’s first 100 kilowatt (kw) wind energy public-private partnership, which spurred investment by the private sector of an additional 2 megawatts in the wind sector.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fueling Ethiopia’s Growth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ethiopia, the economy is growing yet remains overwhelmingly poor and rural, so the country is building at least 12 industrial parks to attract investment and create jobs in needful areas. Accordingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ethiopia-private-enterprise-programme-ethiopia-pepe&quot;&gt;Enterprise Partners&lt;/a&gt; program is working with employers at the flagship Hawassa Industrial Park—which hosts firms making clothes for brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein—by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/development-secretary-priti-patel-stresses-economic-growth-in-visit-to-ethiopia-industrial-park&quot;&gt;organizing training for an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 jobs&lt;/a&gt; in factory operations, warehousing, cleaning, maintenance, and transportation. Five factories are already exporting from the park and 30 other investors have booked production space. The park’s international tenants are covering 75 percent of recruiting and training costs. Similar foreign-funded and market-driven job development is anticipated at the other industrial parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also under Enterprise Partners, the team is:
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting the Government of Ethiopia to develop a foreign and domestic investment strategy to meet the demand for “fast fashion”—that is, the capacity to respond quickly to trends in the global apparel sector; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing a bank-managed loan facility where potential investors and investees of private capital in the Ethiopian equity market can use interest-free loans to hire high-quality investment advisors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Blended-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Blended-7&quot; title=&quot;Employees making clothing at the Hawassa Industrial Park in Ethiopia.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Helping Companies Overcome Capital Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialsector/brief/smes-finance&quot;&gt;400 million small and medium-sized businesses in emerging markets&lt;/a&gt; represent hardworking business owners and real growth potential, but development actors and private investors have only scratched the surface of the opportunities at hand. These businesses’ demand for capital is sometimes being met domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the USAID/Kenya &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-financial-inclusion-rural-microenterprises-firm&quot;&gt;Financial Inclusion for Rural Microenterprises&lt;/a&gt; (FIRM) project, DAI &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/unlocking-capital-across-kenya-how-usaid-firm-pushed-the-frontier-of-financial-services-and-built-a-foundation-for-economic-growth/&quot;&gt;unlocked $1 billion-plus in financing&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for rural businesspeople. The FIRM team worked with more than 100 financial institutions to develop loan products, and demand for capital in marginalized areas did the rest, spurring investment in sectors such as agriculture, water, energy generation, and ICT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, $186.3 million was leveraged under FIRM for private sector investments in agricultural and food value chains. A pipeline of clean energy projects was developed, with a $7 million deal for a hydroelectric power plant on the Yala River closed in December 2016. Another $120 million in Development Credit Authority guarantees supported $43 million in reduced-risk loans with 16 partner financial institutions. Most importantly, FIRM built a foundation of financial professionals and institutions that will serve the country’s markets for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_copy-061972071246&quot; title=&quot;Copy: &quot; src=&quot;//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed.js?j3F&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Poland, where the economy is growing but not energy efficient or environmentally sensitive, DAI and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development helped &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/polseff-legacy-lower-energy-bills-for-businesses-across-poland-a-financing-model-to-scale-and-replicate/&quot;&gt;create the country’s energy finance sector&lt;/a&gt;. Over seven years, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/poland-polish-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-polseff&quot;&gt;Polish Sustainable Energy Finance Facility&lt;/a&gt; (PolSEFF) assisted five domestic banks to appraise and close more than 2,000 investment opportunities for business owners who had no way to capitalize new or upgraded equipment for heating, cooling, electric power, and insulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The businesses’ investments, averaging €100,000, are paying for themselves through lowered energy costs. In training 840 bank and leasing staff on responsibly financing energy projects—and developing an online catalogue of more than 700 registered companies and 7,000 eligible products—PolSEFF is well positioned to help capitalize Polish energy needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy finance is a ripe market—DAI also manages the SEFF facility in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/morocco-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-morseff&quot;&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and is a consortium member in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/western-balkans-sustainable-energy-finance-facility-webseff-i-ii&quot;&gt;Western Balkans SEFF&lt;/a&gt;, which together with PolSEFF aim to manage €430 million for energy efficiency investments by small and growing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact Bonds in Palestine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Palestine, World Bank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/palestine-finance-for-jobs-f4j&quot;&gt;Finance for Jobs&lt;/a&gt; (F4J) aims to mobilize private investment and create jobs in the West Bank and Gaza by crowding in private investment, including by: 1) an Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Matching Grant Facility that targets early-stage investment funds for viable projects; and 2) a Development Impact Bond to be issued by the Palestinian Authority. F4J will build capacity in the Palestinian Authority through technical assistance, training, secondments, and internships, and by providing facilities, equipment, and software.&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Facilitating Capital Flow for Water Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will pay for clean water linked to good accessibility and service quality. In the Philippines, public investment for water supply and sanitation projects historically covered only about 20 percent of the need. USAID and DAI &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/innovative-fund-enables-philippine-water-utilities-to-invest/&quot;&gt;closed the financial gap&lt;/a&gt; by institutionalizing private financing for water supply and sanitation projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging development assistance from Japan, blended capital co-financing between the Philippine government and private banks, and risk-absorbing guarantees, the water industry mobilized more than PhP10.5 billion (US$234 million) in mostly private capital for water and sanitation infrastructure. More than 40 projects were funded, affording 1.3 million Filipinos access to safe water or improved services, with another 5 million projected to be served. Effectively, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/philippines-water-revolving-fund-support-program-pwrf&quot;&gt;Philippines Water Revolving Fund&lt;/a&gt; created by USAID and DAI shifted the Philippines’ water-financing paradigm from purely public to public-private. Today, private banks continue to originate loans with water districts and local government units driven by demand from water consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, to overcome the risk-return hurdle for water investments in Cambodia, water companies jumped at the chance to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUlchUgIvyw&quot;&gt;acquire results-based financing&lt;/a&gt; to close the financial gap that had prevented the expansion of residential water hookups. By taking advantage of this capital, they extended services to 67,000 new customers in just 18 months while making operational upgrades that benefitted an additional 130,000 rural poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;395&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/37755989?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;703&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Capital—The Next Level of Development Partnering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international development community has been ramping up its partnerships since at least 2001, when USAID launched its Global Development Alliances initiative. Starting in 2010, under USAID’s Grand Challenges for Development program, DAI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-grand-challenges-development-implementation-services&quot;&gt;administered global competitions&lt;/a&gt;—in water access, agricultural mechanization, health services, and literacy—that attracted thousands of entries, led to 104 awards between $100,000 and $2 million, and leveraged $124 million in external funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAI itself has made the commitment to invest in companies that have good prospects of delivering reasonable returns while generating development results. For example, in 2002, USAID contracted DAI to assume management of Khan Bank (then known as the Agricultural Bank of Mongolia, an institution indispensable to rural Mongolians) and prepare it for sale. The DAI-led team transformed the failing bank, implementing new policies and procedures, developing and retraining staff, rebranding and marketing the organization, developing new products, and inculcating new values and behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2003, the now-private Khan Bank has been one of the two largest banks in the country, and today it boasts the highest profitability and return on assets. Khan Bank has evolved into a full service universal bank with total assets of $2.7 billion and a network of 536 branches with over 5,000 employees. Equity has increased from $6.5 million to $333 million and loans outstanding rose from $67 million in 2004 to $1.6 billion in 2015. After the USAID engagement and privatization, Khan Bank’s new owners hired DAI directly and DAI took a small ownership stake via stock options based on performance &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1akaSFOqjWaQdClEsBv_I-TROc6SekbAnVJJAXiifct4&amp;amp;font=Default&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;hash_bookmark=true&amp;amp;initial_zoom=2#event-out-of-africa-the-nmb-connection&quot;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, DAI has invested in small and growing businesses offering technological solutions to development problems: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In February 2017, DAI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-invests-in-thinkmds-clinical-assessment-technology&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a financial commitment to ThinkMD, an early-stage global healthcare innovation company whose first product, MEDSINC, is a mobile clinical assessment platform that enables anyone, anywhere to assess the sickness of a child and provide triage and treatment recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In March, DAI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-invests-in-mobileodt-a-breakthrough-provider-of-cervical-cancer-detection-tech?related-box&quot;&gt;invested&lt;/a&gt; in the mHealth service provider MobileODT, which combines advanced optical technology with smartphone capabilities to bring affordable cancer detection services to underserved communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In April, DAI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-joins-forces-with-local-content-solutions-ltd&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; U.K.-based Local Content Solutions to complement DAI’s work in the oil, gas, mining, and infrastructure sectors in corporate social investment, government and community engagement, and local content and related supply chain management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAI &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-joins-investors-circle-ande-global-leaders-in-mobilizing-investment-and-capital-for-small-and-growing-businesses&quot;&gt;recently joined&lt;/a&gt; the Global Accelerator Network, Investors’ Circle and the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs, global leaders in supporting small and growing businesses dedicated to improving their communities and the world. DAI has formed consortia with these and other organizations to pursue opportunities in blended finance. Together, we are confident that companies and investors will increasingly seek to invest capital in emerging markets that will generate positive financial and social returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Devs----Blended-pic-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Devs----Blended-pic-5&quot; title=&quot;A community health worker in Bangladesh using the MEDSINC platform developed by DAI partner ThinkMD.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leveraging Development Assistance to Invest Profitably&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, USAID, other donors, and their implementing partners have a deep and growing well of in-country experience in the investment arena—experience on which investors can draw to reduce their risk in markets that have tremendous upside. At the same time, USAID’s assistance to investors is increasingly producing development results such as economic growth, expanded access to energy and water, and increased stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As USAID and other donors and investors explore these opportunities in blended finance, they can do so knowing that there is an abundance of local expertise and entrepreneurial energy primed to assist, in all corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PolSEFF’s Legacy: Lower Energy Bills for Businesses Across Poland; a Financing Model to Scale and Replicate</title>
      <link>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/polseff-legacy-lower-energy-bills-for-businesses-across-poland-a-financing-model-to-scale-and-replicate</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2017 17:37:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/polseff-legacy-lower-energy-bills-for-businesses-across-poland-a-financing-model-to-scale-and-replicate</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Poland’s private sector grew steadily in the post-Soviet era, its reliance on old energy equipment and poorly insulated facilities contributed to the country becoming one of the highest energy consumers in Europe. In 2010, when the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) launched the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/poland-polish-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-polseff&quot;&gt;Polish Sustainable Energy Financing Facility &lt;/a&gt;(PolSEFF), few business owners had invested in energy efficiency measures compared with the European Union average, and Polish lending institutions were not prepared to finance these types of upgrades. As a result, business owners continued to pay unnecessarily high energy bills and emit unnecessarily high amounts of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland has since seen the emergence of a thriving energy finance sector. Under PolSEFF and PolSEFF 2, both managed by DAI, more than 2,000 businesses took out loans to finance new and upgraded equipment and insulation that reduced their energy usage and saved them significant money. Investments such as these might seem like an obvious choice, but creating and sustaining this new financial sector required multifaceted assistance from the PolSEFF team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building an Energy Finance Sector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EBRD’s sustainable energy financing facilities (SEFFs) work by offering large initial loans to financial institutions in a country for “on-lending” to businesses to pay for energy efficiency projects. Under both phases of PolSEFF, five partner financial institutions loaned more than €200 million from the EBRD to Polish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs, or businesses with 250 or fewer employees). PolSEFF advisors trained staff members at these lending institutions to package and market the new loans, including how to calculate average return on investment from energy-efficient appliances and determine reasonable interest rates, down payments, and collateral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect lending institutions to borrowers, PolSEFF conducted publicity campaigns and events to promote the specialized loans to targeted businesses and provided technical advice on energy efficiency options to interested companies. The facility also offered 10 to 15 percent of the total loan for companies to keep as a grant, with funding provided by the European Union for PolSEFF and by the Polish National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for PolSEFF 2. As word spread, PolSEFF found interested borrowers from numerous industries, from a frozen food manufacturer in need of a better cooling system to an advertising agency seeking a more efficient printing press. The PolSEFF team provided independent assessments on the viability of the proposed projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Mine_Master_conultant_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mine_Master_conultant_1&quot; title=&quot;PolSEFF consultants provided assessments to businesses.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since businesses and financial institutions were unsure of which products qualified as energy efficient under the loan terms, PolSEFF developed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Ww7Rydywh6Y&quot;&gt;List of Eligible Materials and Equipment&lt;/a&gt; (LEME), an online searchable catalogue of pre-approved energy-efficient products. The LEME continues to be widely utilized by lenders and borrowers, with more than 70 percent of products purchased and leased under PolSEFF coming from the catalogue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quick Returns on Investment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New business investments can take years before owners see a payoff, but many PolSEFF borrowers did not wait long to see a positive impact on their bottom lines. For example, Mine Master, a producer of drilling and bolting machinery for the mining industry, suffered from high heating costs due to poorly insulated production facilities. After deciding to invest in a new heating system and modern insulation, PolSEFF engineers advised Mine Master on the best type of insulation materials and quantity needed. “The results exceeded my expectations,” said Jerzy Nadolny, president of Mine Master’s management board. “We expected that we could achieve energy savings of 30 percent, but in fact we recorded savings of 50 percent, which is a lot for a company like us.” See the video below about Mine Master: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/68727241&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PH Jarex, a family-run flower business, used a PolSEFF loan to purchase a cutting-edge combined heat and power generator for its expansive indoor growing facilities. The company reduced its annual energy usage by 41 percent, saving €233,000 a year and reducing its carbon dioxide emissions by more than 3,000 tons. In addition to saving money, the updated generator offered another benefit that complemented the company’s product line. “The unit is equipped with a COdiNOx catalytic converter,” said Agnieszka Plasek, Managing Director at PH Jarex. “Normally the combustion products are emitted into the atmosphere, but we utilize the carbon dioxide instead of releasing it into the atmosphere; it is fed into the greenhouses where plants process it into oxygen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PH_Jarex.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PH_Jarex&quot; title=&quot;PH Jarex, a family-run flower business, used a loan to purchase a cutting-edge combined heat and power generator for its indoor growing facilities.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Growing Impact of Energy Finance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, the EBRD’s sustainable energy financing facilities have provided more than €2.8 billion in financing to 104 financial institutions in 22 countries, which was on-lent to 75,000 clients. The EBRD recently re-branded SEFFs as GEFFs (Green Economy Financing Facilities), which now include financing for a wider range of resource efficiency, such as upgrades that reduce water usage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DAI’s partnership with the EBRD and its energy financing facilities began in Bulgaria with management of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/bulgaria-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy-credit-line-support-rational&quot;&gt;Bulgarian Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Credit Line &lt;/a&gt; from 2004 to 2013. In addition to PolSEFF, DAI manages the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/morocco-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-morseff&quot;&gt;SEFF in Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and is a consortium member in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/western-balkans-sustainable-energy-finance-facility-webseff-i-ii&quot;&gt;Western Balkans SEFF&lt;/a&gt;. These facilities together aim to distribute €170 million to companies to finance energy efficiency projects. The EBRD expanded its work in Poland in 2016 by launching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/polish-residential-energy-efficiency-financing-facility-poland-reff&quot;&gt;Poland Residential Energy Financing Facility&lt;/a&gt;, managed by a consortium of the Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency and DAI, to improve energy efficiency in the residential sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PolSEFF&amp;rsquo;s Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across more than 2,000 projects in all 16 of Poland’s provinces, PolSEFF helped the country’s private sector achieve annual energy savings of 342,000 megawatt hours and avoid more than 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year—the equivalent of the annual energy consumption of 44,000 Polish households and carbon dioxide emissions of 50,000 cars. For its innovative use of market-driven financing to bring about these reductions, PolSEFF was honored with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/polish-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-wins-clean-energy-award&quot;&gt;Financing Deal of the Year award&lt;/a&gt; at the 2016 Central and Eastern European Clean Energy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/PolSEFF_award.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;EBRDawardPolSEFF&quot; title=&quot;Anna Chmielewska, Principal Banker at the EBRD, accepting PolSEFF&amp;#39;s Financing Deal of the Year award at the 2016 Central and Eastern European Clean Energy Awards.&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PolSEFF’s most enduring legacy will be establishing a self-sustaining energy efficiency financing market in Poland. By training 840 staff at five financial institutions, PolSEFF built the capability of lenders to carry on energy financing initiatives. For example, Bank BNP Paribas signed onto the Green Initiative sponsored by the European Investment Bank, which functioned similarly to the ERBD’s SEFF model, while continuing to lend PolSEFF 2 extension funds. Two additional lenders have taken loans from the EBRD for financing programs that will utilize PolSEFF’s LEME catalogue, and the remaining two expressed interest in taking new funds to continue similar programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By demonstrating the viability of innovative energy financing approaches, PolSEFF paved the way for future lending facilities. PolSEFF was the first EBRD facility to introduce loans for leasing equipment, and PolSEFF’s LEME will remain active for continued use. The EBRD is working on a larger, global LEME—the Technology Selector—which will widen categories to include water and material efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2017, at the 11th &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eudevdays.eu/&quot;&gt;European Development Days&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels, leaders from the European Commission and their development partners, including the EBRD, meet to share lessons learned and discuss trends and challenges. This year’s theme—“Investing in Development,” focusing on private sector engagement—marks a fitting opportunity to share the success and significance of PolSEFF, which exemplifies how market-driven, private sector-led solutions can reconcile business growth and reduced carbon emissions, and show that goals once viewed as mutually exclusive can in fact go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Philippines Increases Tax Collections by $1.1 Billion Year Over Year—Without Raising Rates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would you do with an extra $1.1 billion? That amount represents the additional taxes collected by the Philippines government during the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period in 2016. This 12.2 percent increase—during the country&amp;rsquo;s tax-collecting season—followed the rapid adoption by taxpayers of an electronic tax-filing system introduced by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/philippines-facilitating-public-investment-fpi&quot;&gt;Facilitating Public Investment&lt;/a&gt; (FPI) program, implemented by DAI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By increasing Q1 tax collections from PHP421.4 billion to PHP472.9 billion, or US$8.4 billion to $9.5 billion—without raising tax rates—the Philippines will be able to invest in its ambitious program to develop infrastructure and eradicate extreme poverty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_e_filing_soars_in_philippines_fueling_tax_revenue_growth&quot; title=&quot;E-Filing Soars in Philippines, Fueling Tax-Revenue Growth&quot; src=&quot;//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed.js?odf&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2013, FPI has assisted the Philippines’ Bureau for Internal Revenue (BIR) to improve its e-filing and e-payment systems, and recently the FPI team assisted the Department of Finance (DOF) in drafting comprehensive tax reform, including tax policy and administration. FPI continues to assist the DOF as the proposed reform goes through parliamentary debates and to facilitate numerous public-private policy dialogue events on the proposed changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since introducing electronic BIR forms in 2015, the Philippines government has &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/philippines-experiences-major-increase-in-electronic-tax-filing/&quot;&gt;seen the popularity of its electronic tax-filing option soar&lt;/a&gt;—from 1.9 million electronic returns in 2014 to 17.4 million in 2016. While only certain taxpayers were mandated to use e-filing, the BIR reported increased e-filing across all taxpayer categories as Filipinos found the new eBIRForms system to be stable and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;aside&gt;Complementing its work on the revenue side, FPI is also ramping up its assistance to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), including:
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting passage of a new Budget Law, currently filed for parliamentary discussion, that will establish a performance-based-budgeting process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparing a new Budget Manual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing a comprehensive system for monitoring and evaluating expenditures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving government procurement processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advising on budget decentralization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineering business processes related to budget preparation and execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting the Philippines’ Open Government Partnership&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Homegrown Revenues for Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines’ achievement &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/long-term-fiscal-reform-takes-root-in-el-salvador-and-elsewhere/&quot;&gt;exemplifies an encouraging trend&lt;/a&gt; of developing countries undertaking fiscal reforms to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/when-tax-reform-leads-to-increased-funding-for-health-services/&quot;&gt;increase their domestic resource mobilization&lt;/a&gt;. At the July 2015 Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia—attended by more than 110 heads of state, ministers, and officials from 38 countries—donors such as USAID and the U.K. Department for International Development pledged a doubling of assistance by 2020 for programs to mobilize domestic revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping up domestic resource mobilization, the Addis attendees agreed, “is core to ensuring solid financing of the Post-2015 Development Agenda. [While] domestic public resources are a more stable and sustainable source of income, they also strengthen a legitimate relationship between citizens and the state and foster good governance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Philippines first attempted to introduce e-filing 17 years ago, it was one of just a few countries using the method. Electronic filing and payments seemed like a perfect solution for a country with a population dispersed across more than 7,000 islands. However, e-filing was never adopted in significant numbers due to persistent technical issues and the e-system’s complicated design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with an unstable e-filing system and impending April 15 filing deadline, many taxpayers simply did not file or pay their taxes. In mid-2015, FPI provided a new design to the BIR that made e-filing readily available, convenient, and scalable. Compared to the old system or manual filing using paper returns, the new system has greatly improved taxpayer service and compliance. For taxpayers who need in-person service, waiting lines in regional tax administration offices have been reduced by hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_fiscal_space____philippines_fpi&quot; title=&quot;Fiscal Space -- Philippines FPI&quot; src=&quot;//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed.js?6L7&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beyond Hardware and Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes more than rolling out new hardware and software to bridge a country’s fiscal gaps. FPI led a nationwide public awareness campaign, worked with mobile payment providers and local banks to expand channels and locations for tax payments, and intensively promoted good governance and anti-corruption transparency initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course there is always an opportunity to scrutinize how you spend the money that is raised, and spend it more wisely. For example, FPI’s technical assistance to the DBM streamlined key internal business processes and helped identify the opportunity to free up $500 million within the 2016 national government budget. Collectively, FPI’s activities have helped expand the Philippines government’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/how-tax-assistance-from-usaid-dfid-helps-developing-countries-to-manage-money-and-help-themselves/&quot;&gt;fiscal space&lt;/a&gt;” for investing domestically in its own development, a result we are confident will endure beyond the life of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
