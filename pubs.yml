  summary: |
    Six Jordanian pharmaceutical companies have reported an additional US$55.6 million in exports since installing the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) system in December 2016. The installation allows the companies to register their drugs in foreign markets using internationally recognized standards, enabling faster and more competitive delivery. Representing sales through the eCDT, this increase is additional to pre-eCDT projections.The Jordan Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (JAPM) managed the  eCTD installation with assistance from the Jordan Competitiveness Program (JCP), a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initiative to support economic growth and investment in the Kingdom. The pharmaceutical industry represents a pillar of Jordan’s economy and is one of its few net-exporters. Faced with increasing competition, the six pharmaceutical companies partnered with JCP to strengthen their export position.Since its inception in 2013, JCP has helped to:Automate drug registration to accelerate reviews of new drug submissions, especially locally manufactured generics;Clear a backlog of drugs awaiting registration;Strengthen the JAPM and Jordan Food &amp; Drug Administration (JFDA) through capacity building, workshops, personal coaching, and technical assistance; andReform regulations and processes to support drug manufacture and export.Implemented by DAI, JCP also assisted the JFDA to customize, procure, and install its eCTD system and provided intensive training on its use, raising JFDA operations to internationally accepted standards.To learn more about this work, please watch the video below: Jordan Pharma: Too Big to FailJordan&rsquo;s pharmaceutical sector was, to borrow a phrase, &ldquo;too big to fail&quot;—a signature industry that contributed tens of millions of dollars to a national economy that has struggled under the weight of an unprecedented refugee crisis. As JCP&rsquo;s remit was to sharpen the competitiveness of Jordan’s economy, the pharmaceutical sector was an obvious choice for the kind of assistance only USAID, with its resources and long history of working with the Jordanian government, could provide.Jordan’s pharmaceutical exports had stagnated in the years before JCP&rsquo;s launch. In its first year, JCP studied Jordan&rsquo;s highest-potential industries and confirmed that pharmaceuticals are a prime driver of economic growth and job creation. At the time, however, the industry was constrained by regional conflicts, including in Iraq and Syria—traditional trading partners whose borders were effectively sealed by ongoing violence—and the loss of main markets such as Libya and Yemen due to war.   With JCP’s assistance, the JFDA and JAPM have strengthened their partnership and aligned their efforts around a common strategy to enhance exports and improve the enabling environment. This agenda spurred new technological enhancements and automation of the drug registration process—at the regulatory agency and at individual companies served by the JAPM—making the process of submitting, reviewing, and approving new drug applications faster and cheaper.A Bastion of the Regional Health EconomyJordan was among the first manufacturers of branded generics in the Arab world—producing common medicines such as acetaminophen that have been sold with Arabic packaging to customers throughout the region. The Middle East and North Africa region has long depended on Jordanian drugs for treating ailments of the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, nervous, skeletal, muscle, reproductive, and endocrine systems. One of the region&rsquo;s largest drug companies, Jordan&rsquo;s Hikma Pharmaceuticals, boasts $2 billion in generic sales worldwide, making it one of the Kingdom&rsquo;s most successful home-grown businesses.    Jordan’s pharmaceutical sector benefits from a highly educated workforce, including a high concentration of pharmacists and entrepreneurs with elite business training. In a market study supported by JCP and performed by healthcare consulting company IQVIA, JAPM estimates that the pharmaceutical industry has exported—albeit inefficiently—to 87 countries worldwide.Located in industrial zones around Amman, Jordan&rsquo;s main pharmaceutical production facilities employ 26,000 Jordanians from throughout the country. Nearly 40 percent of the sector’s workforce is female and two-thirds are highly skilled, with high salary scales compared to other manufacturing industries in Jordan.Protecting Jordan’s Medical Tourism:While Jordan’s medical tourism sector accounts for up to 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, that number plummeted in the years preceding JCP’s launch. In response, JCP channeled a grant to the Private Hospital Association (PHA) to promote Jordan as a leading medical tourism destination. PHA in turn formed the Jordan Medical Tourism Consortium of eight high-profile private hospitals, which subsequently saw substantial increases in patients and contracts from targeted markets in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia. In 2016, for example, these hospitals served 206 patients from target markets in Algeria, Chad, Kazakhstan, and Oman—in 2018, they saw 1,163 patients from those countries, largely people seeking cosmetic surgery, neurological care, orthopedic procedures, organ transplants, and other treatments. Over the same period, the PHA increased from two to 52 its contracts signed with private hospitals across the region to allow their patients to be treated in Jordan. With the grant funding, the Consortium has targeted additional markets, raising awareness of Jordan&rsquo;s medical offerings through online marketing campaigns, tours, and exhibitions. A Source of Jobs for Young JordaniansPharmacy science, including the training of new pharmacists, is one of the most popular fields of study at Jordanian universities. According to the JAPM, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed some 30 million Jordanian dinars, or $42.3 million, to fund research and development benefiting the country’s pharmacy schools. The sector is a major engine of job creation for young Jordanians, accounting for approximately 7 percent of the country’s industrial gross domestic product, according to the JAPM.    The surge in pharmaceutical exports benefited Jordan by strengthening the tax base, generating employment, and anchoring local economies where industrial plants are located. As pharmaceutical manufacturing in neighboring Iraq has slowed due to the conflict there, Jordan’s exports to its neighbor have played a vital role in maintaining the Iraqi public’s access to health supplies.    The outlook for Jordan&rsquo;s pharma sector is promising. Its companies are strong, its products continue to enjoy high demand throughout the Arab world, and the workforce that sustains it is among the most skilled in the region. As the industry looks to the future, continuing cooperation between the JFDA and the private sector, represented by the JAPM, will be vital to ensure an enabling environment for sustained growth, job creation, and improved health.

  summary: |
    Voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) are guidelines that industry producers, traders, manufacturers, retailers, or service providers are asked to meet that encourage respect for basic human rights, worker health and safety, environmental impacts, community relations, land-use planning, and more. The standards include certification and ethical branding—such as organic, forest friendly or fairtrade—as well as corporate, ethical, or sustainability standards suppliers are required to meet.VSS have proliferated over the last two decades and increasingly shape global value chains. While most standards are not designed to ensure gender equality, there is an increasing number of gender-focused VSS that are being developed and used by businesses.

    As a grad student in London in the 1990s, I earned a bit of extra money sourcing and exporting handcrafted furniture from India to the United States for interior designers. My U.S. customers were small businesses, but I was even smaller, so if I wanted to sell to them I had to take on most of the risk. On school breaks I would travel to India, find what my customers were looking for, purchase it, accompany it to the port, and—when I could—watch as it was loaded onto a ship.

  summary: |
    After Monika Lalika’s husband passed away, her in-laws did not allow her to use the land he had left her and she used to worry that they would one day claim the property for themselves. For Martha Paulo Mwilongo, a land dispute with her neighbor kept her from selling or renting part of her 11 acres to pay her children’s school fees. Joti Kihongo wanted to expand his general store, but could not get a large enough loan because banks would not recognize his undocumented land as collateral.

  summary: |
    In Mozambique, the Innovation for Agribusiness project (InovAgro) uses a market systems approach to encourage investment by smallholder farmers in agricultural productivity, thereby boosting their incomes. But many of those smallholders find themselves increasingly at risk of losing their land to large investors who, with the backing of the government, are looking to start commercial farming operations encompassing thousands of hectares. This precarious state of affairs, which is in large part due to the government’s very limited formal recognition of smallholder land holdings, has made small farmers more and more reluctant to invest in their land.

  summary: |
    What is a land title worth? The prevailing assumption in development circles is that helping smallholders acquire formal title to the land they farm will help them integrate into formal economic channels, invest more in their property, and access loan financing. But in practice most land titling programs have focused on the process of delivering titles and left the assumption of economic benefits as exactly that—an assumption.

  summary: |
    Girls and women in Afghanistan are transitioning away from Taliban-era oppression to attend school, get jobs, and fully participate in mainstream life. Afghan leaders and politicians have enacted national laws to support this movement, but the reality in Afghanistan’s 34 provinces is another matter. Girls and women in too many locales routinely endure child/forced marriage, domestic assault, and injustice, and female leaders become targeted for reprisals. In the space between the national law and local reality, various groups are working to preserve hard-earned gains and advocate for Afghan women. This is the space where the Musharikat program works.

By the time we conduct the endline, the project is closing. Baseline findings don’t drive programming.That is far from the case with Asegurando la Educación’s baseline survey of school-based violence in Honduras.

Many have good educations and are holding out for high-quality employment. Jordan is also hosting an enormous influx of Syrian refugees, which has helped swell its population from 7.5 million in 2011 to 10 million today. Many of these newcomers are also seeking work. But Jordan is almost completely reliant on imported oil and gas for its energy, limiting its ability to grow the economy and create jobs.

  summary: |
    Despite having the largest economy in Africa, around half of Nigeria’s population still lives in extreme poverty. A few hundred miles east of the new skyscrapers and shopping malls of Nigeria’s commercial capital of Lagos, the Niger Delta—made up of nine oil-producing states and home to more than 31 million people—defines the country’s stark contrast in living conditions. Even though it is a major oil-producing region, much of the Delta’s population lives in remote villages and survives on subsistence farming. Exacerbating this poverty is a lack of modern agricultural equipment and supplies that farmers need to improve crop yields, as well as limited access to markets in which to sell their harvests.
