    Land Titles in Ethiopia Open Doors to Finance and Investment

  summary: |
    While still one of the poorest countries in the world, Ethiopia has made major advances in reducing poverty and increasing agricultural production in recent years. However, the pace of progress is constrained by inefficiencies in the rural land sector, including weak documentation and management of land rights. Land Investment for Transformation (LIFT), a U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) programme, is tackling this issue with a unique approach—by using a market systems lens. And the benefits of this approach are beginning to bear fruit.LIFT supports the Government of Ethiopia’s efforts in rural land certification to drive investment, increase productive land use, and boost the incomes of rural households. The market systems approach addresses constraints that prevent farmers from increasing their productivity. Covering 14 million parcels of land across Ethiopia’s four highland regions, LIFT is the single largest land governance project in DFID’s portfolio and one of the largest in terms of budget and scale of operation funded by any donor globally. Opening New DoorsThe confidence that comes with security of tenure opens up new opportunities. For example, LIFT has developed an individual loan product linked to farmers’ land certificates and is working with microfinance institutions (MFIs) to promote it, enabling farmers to access finance that otherwise has been out of reach in rural areas. Annual interest rates for the loans linked to land certificates issued by LIFT are around 15 to 18 percent, compared to up to 21 percent for group loans from MFIs and up to 120 percent for loans from informal money lenders.Alemneh Bare, a resident of the Womberma district in the Amhara region, is a father of seven young children. Through LIFT, he obtained a land certificate for his 0.75 hectares of land in 2016. Unable to generate enough revenue for his family’s needs from this parcel of land, Bare got a job as a mechanic at a flour mill in the nearest town.In February 2017, he used his land certificate to obtain a 50,000 Ethiopian birr (around £1,400) loan from the Amhara Credit and Savings Institute. Using the loan and existing savings, Bare was able to purchase two diesel-operated flour mills and establish his own milling business. “I am excited to be self-employed, owning and operating my own enterprise,” he said. “My long-term dream has become a tangible reality.” Bare’s business plan is based on meeting the high demand for milling services to neighboring communities. The mill currently offers employment to both him and his spouse. The business is running well, with daily revenue of 1,000 birr (around £28) and an average net profit of 5,000 birr per month (around £140). As a result, taking care of his children and paying school tuition fees is no longer a daunting challenge for him and his wife.Bare is confident that he will repay his loan without much difficulty, as his investment has already started to pay off. His future plans are to increase his savings and, upon repaying the first loan, to apply for an additional loan to expand and improve his milling operation, as well as engage in dairy farming and cattle fattening.Bare’s is one of more than 7,600 loans that have been disbursed through September, worth 222.5 million birr (more than £6 million). At the same time, the loans have allowed the MFIs to leverage more than 21 million birr (around £600,000) in savings, thus increasing their liquidity and allowing them to issue more loans. The MFIs have told the project team they are so happy with this loan product that they are introducing it to non-programme areas, using other land certificates as guarantees—a great example of MFIs expanding and adapting the loan product independently of LIFT.LIFT’s other interventions in the rural land market include developing a standard land rental contract and establishing a network of land rental service providers that can facilitate land rental agreements, thus allowing landholders to access a formalized and secure land rental market. To date, more than 430 land rental service providers have facilitated and formally registered nearly 12,000 rental contracts. LIFT estimates that more than 40 percent of people who rent out land are women, often from female-headed households, who are unable to work all of the parcels they hold. Renting out land gives them additional income, and the standard contract and formalization of the agreement offers them security and peace of mind.Land Registration at ScaleLIFT combines a systematic high-volume strategy to the registering of land parcels with the market systems approach. This combination accelerates and magnifies the impact of improved security of tenure.As of September, roughly 10 million parcels of land have been demarcated by LIFT, with more than 6 million certificates issued and in the hands of farmers. The project aims to register and issue 14 million certificates by 2020, recognizing the rights of all rightful land holders, including men and women in married and unmarried households. By the end of the project, a rural land administration system will be operational in 140 of the nearly 700 districts in Ethiopia. LIFT’s high-volume approach to land certification has the added advantage of reducing the average cost per parcel certified. To date, LIFT has achieved an average cost per certificate of £3.75, compared with £4.68 in Rwanda and £20.45 in Mozambique.

    Women and Girls Advocate for Their Place in Afghanistan’s Social and Political Mainstream

  summary: |
    Girls and women in Afghanistan are transitioning away from Taliban-era oppression to attend school, get jobs, and fully participate in mainstream life. Afghan leaders and politicians have enacted national laws to support this movement, but the reality in Afghanistan’s 34 provinces is another matter. Girls and women in too many locales routinely endure child/forced marriage, domestic assault, and injustice, and female leaders become targeted for reprisals. In the space between the national law and local reality, various groups are working to preserve hard-earned gains and advocate for Afghan women. This is the space where the Musharikat program works.

  summary: |
    Too often, in our experience as development professionals, baseline surveys can seem like proforma exercises—dry, mechanical constructs conducted at the beginning of a project, shelved almost as soon as they are done, then dusted off for the midline survey. By the time we conduct the endline, the project is closing. Baseline findings don’t drive programming.That is far from the case with Asegurando la Educación’s baseline survey of school-based violence in Honduras.

  summary: |
    Governments in many low- and middle-income countries have committed to provide affordable and high-quality health services to their citizens. To make good on these promises, they need to identify more money for health expenditure and need to invest it more wisely. Our recent policy paper—Financial Management Mechanisms to Support Increased Government Spending on Health—provides some guidance on how they might do that.

  summary: |
    Jordan needs to grow its economy. More than 700,000 of its young people—39 percent of the available labor force ages 15 to 24—are without a job. Many have good educations and are holding out for high-quality employment. Jordan is also hosting an enormous influx of Syrian refugees, which has helped swell its population from 7.5 million in 2011 to 10 million today. Many of these newcomers are also seeking work. But Jordan is almost completely reliant on imported oil and gas for its energy, limiting its ability to grow the economy and create jobs.

    Using Market-Driven Strategies to Reduce Poverty and Human Trafficking in Nigeria

  summary: |
    Despite having the largest economy in Africa, around half of Nigeria’s population still lives in extreme poverty. A few hundred miles east of the new skyscrapers and shopping malls of Nigeria’s commercial capital of Lagos, the Niger Delta—made up of nine oil-producing states and home to more than 31 million people—defines the country’s stark contrast in living conditions. Even though it is a major oil-producing region, much of the Delta’s population lives in remote villages and survives on subsistence farming. Exacerbating this poverty is a lack of modern agricultural equipment and supplies that farmers need to improve crop yields, as well as limited access to markets in which to sell their harvests.

  summary: |
    Imagine if you could pay taxes only by traveling to the capital and paying in person—or, by paying in cash at a tax office to a “middleman.” Until recently, this is how taxes were paid in Liberia. Additionally, due to failures by the internet, power supply, or information technology systems, taxpayers often required four trips on average to tax offices to fulfill their obligations. Even basic transactions such as paying for a birth certificate required making a trip to the capital, Monrovia. As a result, many citizens and businesses simply did not comply, depriving the government of revenues needed for services as well as of valuable data.

    When we harness market forces in developing countries, great things can happen—such as countries with surplus food selling to countries that need food. Over the past 15 months, teams from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) East Africa and Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hubs together facilitated three regional trade forums—in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Zambia. This convening of sellers and buyers generated impressive results: signed contracts to sell 1.21 million metric tons of staple grains, with an estimated value of $402 million. When delivered, the grains will be enough to feed 14.4 million people for 12 months.

  summary: |
    Jordan is a relative bastion of stability in the Middle East but is struggling with an unemployment problem. More than 700,000 of its young people—36 percent of the available labor force ages 15–24—are without a job. This percentage is double that of Afghanistan and triple that of Bangladesh, even though those countries register poverty levels far worse than Jordan’s. The problem has intensified since 2011 with the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees following the Syrian crisis.

  summary: |
    Earlier this spring, the East Africa Trade and Investment Hub achieved a major milestone by surpassing the $100-million mark in commercial investment catalyzed into the region. This investment would not have found its way to these markets without the approximately $4 million nudge offered by the Hub, a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initiative implemented by DAI. Given the potential impact of the investee companies, this project shows how a donor like USAID can leverage its relatively scarce capital to crowd in more plentiful commercial funds—a process known as blended finance. The leverage factor is almost 25x.

    Nigeria is the economic heavyweight of West Africa, but it faces challenges. Approximately two-thirds of its people live in poverty and its economy suffers from low productivity and an uneven climate for trade and investment. Until recently, oil-rich Nigeria has not been a good place to make products or grow crops because it didn’t have to be—the country simply imported what it needed. But times are changing for Africa’s most populous nation.

  summary: |
    Malawi has suffered from poor food production for decades—its 17 million people are mostly smallholder or subsistence farmers who have struggled to overcome drought, pests, and outdated farming practices. Even successful harvests are diminished because they have few options to process and store their crops for sale, resulting in post-harvest losses that cut deeply into already small profits. But development assistance from the United States and European Union is helping Malawi address its shortage of warehousing.
